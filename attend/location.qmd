**Three international airports are located less than 90 minutes from Grenoble**: Lyon Saint-Exupéry, Grenoble Alpes Isère and Geneva. In total, more than 200 direct destinations are accessible.

With up to 10 direct Grenoble-Paris round trips by high-speed TGV train, and with the Lyon Part-Dieu hub 1hr15mins away, **the rail offer from Grenoble is also very attractive**. Ideally located in the city centre, Grenoble railway station is perfectly connected to the city's bus and tram network. 

Finally, the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes motorway network is the most densely populated area after Île-de-France. Thanks to the A41, A48, A49 and A51 motorways, **Grenoble is easily connected to Lyon, the Rhone Valley, Switzerland and Italy**.

Upon arrival in Grenoble, we recommend that attendees stay in the city centre (see [Accommodation](accommodation.qmd)) and use the tram to travel to and from the conference venue on campus.
