::: {.column width="60%"}
Between the Welcome Reception and the Gala Dinner, Wednesday evening will be free for attendees to enjoy at their leisure.

You might take this opportunity to go to the Bastille (especially if you missed the Welcome Reception), explore the Grenoble Museum, or simply stroll through the city. Both the Bastille and the museum are free to access with the GPASS. The GPASS also offers discounts on various other activities and in selected shops—perfect if you'd like to bring home some local products.

In addition, between Wednesday the 16th and Sunday the 20th, a free music festival will take place in the city centre from 7 pm each evening, [here is the programme](https://www.grenoble.fr/951-programmation-2025.htm). What better way to end the day than with international music acts.
