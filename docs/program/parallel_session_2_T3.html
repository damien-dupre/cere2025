Emotional integration involves neither actively suppressing feelings nor quickly reframing appraisals to change what is felt. Instead, individuals receptively allow emotions and actively take an interest in their emotional experiences and their meaning. This approach enables them to make informed choices about subsequent actions, which may include either voluntarily expressing emotions and seeking emotional support from others or deliberately withholding them. Thus, consistent with the core SDT distinction between controlled and autonomous behavioral regulation, emotional integration represents an autonomous form of regulation, contrasting with defensive suppression or stifling of emotional experiences. This symposium will provide deeper insights into the outcomes of emotional integration and the processes that underpin its benefits in different contexts that may elicit intense negative emotions. The first talk presents three studies examining the effects of emotional integration on social justice. The second involves three studies investigating its impact on empathy and the support of pacifying policies in the context of intractable conflict. The third discusses the use of a diary study to explore how emotion regulation motivates goal-directed behaviors. Finally, the fourth talk delves into the experiences of adults who endured child maltreatment and other childhood traumas, analyzing how different emotion regulation styles when recalling these memories are linked to well-being. Together, these talks illustrate the pivotal role of emotional integration in fostering well-being and adaptive responses across diverse and challenging contexts, highlighting its potential to enhance social justice, empathy, goal-directed behavior, and emotional resilience in the face of trauma. Symposium Talk 1: Title and Abstract The Importance of Emotional Openness in Social Action  People vary in the degree to which they acknowledge and take interest in their emotions as opposed to ignoring or suppressing them. Although integrative emotion regulation has proven important for both psychological wellbeing and prosocial behavior, relatively less is known about its role in behaviors related to social justice. Because campaigning for social justice is arduous, often requiring sustained confrontation of social structures of power, it requires highly motivated, flexible, and constructive emotional regulation. Being open to and accepting one's emotional experience is necessary for preserving and regulating emotion in constructive and assertive ways. This talk examines the critical function of emotional openness in two important domains of social action – antiracism and climate activism. Study 1 (n=440) examines the role of emotional openness in antiracism and social justice behaviors, revealing that it explains more variance in these outcomes than do other known predictors of prejudice. In study 2 (n=260), those with more active interest in their own emotions show an increase in antiracist motivation after exposure to a confrontational antiracist message, whereas those with less emotional openness show no change in motivation. Finally, study 3 (n=250) assesses the novel construct of climate anger (i.e., anger that little is being done to preserve the biosphere), by examining how integrated (i.e., open, honest) emotion regulation relates to sustained climate action through constructive responding to one's climate anger and rage. Importantly, these three studies show that proactive interest in one's emotions is what drives these effects, rather than other competing predictors like motivational orientation or trait empathy. Taken together, results highlight that agentic and authentic emotional acceptance may be essential for sustaining high effort behavior aimed at tackling injustice. Symposium Talk 2: Title and Abstract Empathize with The Enemy: Emotion Regulation, Empathy, and Support for Pacifying Policies in Intractable Conflicts. Negative emotions often impede the resolution of intractable intergroup conflicts, making their adaptive regulation essential for reconciliation. Integrative emotion regulation (IER), which entails actively engaging with one's negative emotions, holds promise due to its demonstrated connection to empathy and support for conciliatory policies in the context of the Middle East conflict. However, prior work did not test whether the links hold when negative emotions related to the conflict are elicited. We conducted three experiments with Jewish-Israelis to test these links, focusing on participants' reactions to adversities of Palestinians. In the first two, we compared a negative emotion condition (Study 1: fear; N=240; Study 2: anger, N=293) to a neutral control condition. Our findings replicated positive relations between IER, empathy, and support for conciliatory policies even when negative emotions were elicited. In the third experiment, we also compared a fear condition to a neutral control condition (N=471; 50.5% women; mean age: 43.67; SD=12.92), but this time we tested the association between IER, empathy, and two types of victimhood beliefs. Exclusive victimhood beliefs involve a perception that the ingroup suffers much more than the outgroup, whereas inclusive victimhood beliefs involve the perception of mutual adversity. Past research has found the latter may promote support for conciliatory policies. The third experiment's findings replicated the positive relations between IER and empathy and showed empathy mediated the association between IER and inclusive victimhood regardless of emotion elicitation. These results support the assumption that showing interest in others' adversities is, to some extent, predicted by individuals' tendency to engage with their own negative emotions (i.e., IER). The findings are discussed in relation to prior research on emotion regulation in group contexts, including applications to conflict resolution. Symposium Talk 3: Title and Abstract The Impact of Goal Self-Concordance on Emotion Regulation during Academic Goal Pursuit: A Multilevel Latent Profile Analysis Approach Goal pursuit begins with setting a goal and continues with striving to attain the goal. Both stages are critical for the quality of the process. Research based on the self-concordance model (Sheldon &amp; Elliot, 1998) shows setting self-concordant goals—those aligned with one's values, interests, and ideals—facilitates goal pursuit. During goal striving, recent research suggests that emotion regulation strategies focused on engaging with emotions—either by taking an interest in them (i.e., emotional integration) or by reframing them (i.e., reappraisal)—facilitate goal pursuit, while emotional suppression impedes the process. Benita et al. (2023) have shown the quality of the goal-setting stage can significantly influence the quality of emotion regulation strategies used at goal striving. However, recent studies utilizing multilevel latent profile analysis (ML-LPA) (e.g., Grommisch et al., 2020) indicate that the quality of emotion regulation involves more than just the type of strategy. It also depends on the degree and consistency of strategy use. This study investigated how self-concordant goals influence the type, degree, and consistency of emotion regulation in goal pursuit. Using ML-LPA, we identified emotion regulation profiles and explored their role as mediators between goal self-concordance and goal pursuit outcomes. A sample of 366 undergraduates (77% female, M age = 20.04, SD = 1.49) participated in a daily diary study. Each morning, participants reported an academic goal and its self-concordance. Each evening, they reported their emotion regulation strategies for goal-related negative emotions and goal pursuit outcomes. We identified four day-level and five person-level profiles that varied in strategy type, degree, and consistency. Goal self-concordance predicted optimal outcomes by increasing the likelihood of profiles with engagement-type strategies (i.e. emotional integration and reappraisal) and high consistency while reducing profiles with low degree and inconsistency. This study advances understanding of the role of emotion regulation in motivating goal-directed behavior. Symposium Talk 4: Title and Abstract Emotion Regulation in Adults' Memories of Child Maltreatment: Implications for Mental Health Negative traumatic past events remain encoded in memories and recalling them is typically a difficult experience that requires emotion regulation strategies, even years after the event occurred. In this study, 1,000 adults (18 to 83, M = 42.3 years) recruited from the general population and who had experienced child maltreatment (physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; physical or emotional neglect; or witness of intimate partner abuse) before the age of 18 recalled a memory of one of their experiences of child maltreatment and another memory related to a traumatic or distressful event experienced as a child, but unrelated to child maltreatment (e.g., a car accident). For each of their two memories, participants indicated what type of emotion regulation strategies they still need to use when recalling those memories today—integrative regulation, amotivated regulation (dysregulation), or controlled regulation. Results of regression analyses showed that amotivated regulation in both types of memories positively and independently predicted current symptoms of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and suicidal intentions. The coefficient of the child maltreatment memory was double the size of the coefficient of the traumatic memory. Conversely, integrative regulation in each type of memories was negatively and independently associated with most of these symptoms, with coefficients of the same size. These results held after controlling for the intensity of child maltreatment (as measured by the Child Trauma Questionnaire) and general emotion regulation capacities and were not moderated by age groups (18 to 39 years old vs. 40 years and over). These results suggest that the way each single memory remains emotionally regulated matters in terms of mental health and captures variance that is independent of global capacities. Targeting specific traumatic memories may be a fruitful avenue for clinical interventions.  "],["Parallel Session 2","T3","13:30  -  14:30","Symposium","Emotional Integration versus Emotional Avoidance: A Self-Determination Theory Approach to Adaptive Emotion Regulation - Chair: Guy Roth","Symposium General Abstract Over the past 15 years, extensive research rooted in Self-Determination Theory (SDT) has highlighted the adaptive role of emotional integration for well-being and adaptive functioning across domains that often evoke negative emotions, such as close relationships, prosocial behavior, goal pursuit, and coping with academic failures.

In the third experiment, we also compared a fear condition to a neutral control condition (N=471; 50.5% women; mean age: 43.67; SD=12.92), but this time we tested the association between IER, empathy, and two types of victimhood beliefs. Exclusive victimhood beliefs involve a perception that the ingroup suffers much more than the outgroup, whereas inclusive victimhood beliefs involve the perception of mutual adversity. Past research has found the latter may promote support for conciliatory policies. The third experiment's findings replicated the positive relations between IER and empathy and showed empathy mediated the association between IER and inclusive victimhood regardless of emotion elicitation. These results support the assumption that showing interest in others' adversities is, to some extent, predicted by individuals' tendency to engage with their own negative emotions (i.e., IER). The findings are discussed in relation to prior research on emotion regulation in group contexts, including applications to conflict resolution. Symposium Talk 3: Title and Abstract The Impact of Goal Self-Concordance on Emotion Regulation during Academic Goal Pursuit: A Multilevel Latent Profile Analysis Approach Goal pursuit begins with setting a goal and continues with striving to attain the goal. Both stages are critical for the quality of the process. Research based on the self-concordance model (Sheldon &amp; Elliot, 1998) shows setting self-concordant goals—those aligned with one's values, interests, and ideals—facilitates goal pursuit. During goal striving, recent research suggests that emotion regulation strategies focused on engaging with emotions—either by taking an interest in them (i.e., emotional integration) or by reframing them (i.e., reappraisal)—facilitate goal pursuit, while emotional suppression impedes the process. Benita et al. (2023) have shown the quality of the goal-setting stage can significantly influence the quality of emotion regulation strategies used at goal striving. However, recent studies utilizing multilevel latent profile analysis (ML-LPA) (e.g., Grommisch et al., 2020) indicate that the quality of emotion regulation involves more than just the type of strategy. It also depends on the degree and consistency of strategy use. This study investigated how self-concordant goals influence the type, degree, and consistency of emotion regulation in goal pursuit. Using ML-LPA, we identified emotion regulation profiles and explored their role as mediators between goal self-concordance and goal pursuit outcomes. A sample of 366 undergraduates (77% female, M age = 20.04, SD = 1.49) participated in a daily diary study. Each morning, participants reported an academic goal and its self-concordance. Each evening, they reported their emotion regulation strategies for goal-related negative emotions and goal pursuit outcomes. We identified four day-level and five person-level profiles that varied in strategy type, degree, and consistency. Goal self-concordance predicted optimal outcomes by increasing the likelihood of profiles with engagement-type strategies (i.e. emotional integration and reappraisal) and high consistency while reducing profiles with low degree and inconsistency. This study advances understanding of the role of emotion regulation in motivating goal-directed behavior. Symposium Talk 4: Title and Abstract Emotion Regulation in Adults' Memories of Child Maltreatment: Implications for Mental Health Negative traumatic past events remain encoded in memories and recalling them is typically a difficult experience that requires emotion regulation strategies, even years after the event occurred. In this study, 1,000 adults (18 to 83, M = 42.3 years) recruited from the general population and who had experienced child maltreatment (physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; physical or emotional neglect; or witness of intimate partner abuse) before the age of 18 recalled a memory of one of their experiences of child maltreatment and another memory related to a traumatic or distressful event experienced as a child, but unrelated to child maltreatment (e.g., a car accident). For each of their two memories, participants indicated what type of emotion regulation strategies they still need to use when recalling those memories today—integrative regulation, amotivated regulation (dysregulation), or controlled regulation. Results of regression analyses showed that amotivated regulation in both types of memories positively and independently predicted current symptoms of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and suicidal intentions. The coefficient of the child maltreatment memory was double the size of the coefficient of the traumatic memory. Conversely, integrative regulation in each type of memories was negatively and independently associated with most of these symptoms, with coefficients of the same size. These results held after controlling for the intensity of child maltreatment (as measured by the Child Trauma Questionnaire) and general emotion regulation capacities and were not moderated by age groups (18 to 39 years old vs. 40 years and over). These results suggest that the way each single memory remains emotionally regulated matters in terms of mental health and captures variance that is independent of global capacities. Targeting specific traumatic memories may be a fruitful avenue for clinical interventions.  "]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr><\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"responsive":{"details":{"target":1}},"dom":"t","pageLength":-1,"ordering":false,"columnDefs":[{"name":"rowname","targets":0},{"name":"V1","targets":1},{"name":"V2","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[-1,10,25,50,100],"rowCallback":"function(row, data, displayNum, displayIndex, dataIndex) {\nvar value=data[0]; $(this.api().cell(row, 0).node()).css({'font-weight':'bold','color':'#eeeeee','background-color':'#E84E0F'});\n}"}},"evals":["options.rowCallback"],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Emotional integration involves neither actively suppressing feelings nor quickly reframing appraisals to change what is felt. Instead, individuals receptively allow emotions and actively take an interest in their emotional experiences and their meaning. This approach enables them to make informed choices about subsequent actions, which may include either voluntarily expressing emotions and seeking emotional support from others or deliberately withholding them. Thus, consistent with the core SDT distinction between controlled and autonomous behavioral regulation, emotional integration represents an autonomous form of regulation, contrasting with defensive suppression or stifling of emotional experiences. This symposium will provide deeper insights into the outcomes of emotional integration and the processes that underpin its benefits in different contexts that may elicit intense negative emotions. The first talk presents three studies examining the effects of emotional integration on social justice. The second involves three studies investigating its impact on empathy and the support of pacifying policies in the context of intractable conflict. The third discusses the use of a diary study to explore how emotion regulation motivates goal-directed behaviors. Finally, the fourth talk delves into the experiences of adults who endured child maltreatment and other childhood traumas, analyzing how different emotion regulation styles when recalling these memories are linked to well-being. Together, these talks illustrate the pivotal role of emotional integration in fostering well-being and adaptive responses across diverse and challenging contexts, highlighting its potential to enhance social justice, empathy, goal-directed behavior, and emotional resilience in the face of trauma. Symposium Talk 1: Title and Abstract The Importance of Emotional Openness in Social Action  People vary in the degree to which they acknowledge and take interest in their emotions as opposed to ignoring or suppressing them. Although integrative emotion regulation has proven important for both psychological wellbeing and prosocial behavior, relatively less is known about its role in behaviors related to social justice. Because campaigning for social justice is arduous, often requiring sustained confrontation of social structures of power, it requires highly motivated, flexible, and constructive emotional regulation. Being open to and accepting one's emotional experience is necessary for preserving and regulating emotion in constructive and assertive ways. This talk examines the critical function of emotional openness in two important domains of social action – antiracism and climate activism. Study 1 (n=440) examines the role of emotional openness in antiracism and social justice behaviors, revealing that it explains more variance in these outcomes than do other known predictors of prejudice. In study 2 (n=260), those with more active interest in their own emotions show an increase in antiracist motivation after exposure to a confrontational antiracist message, whereas those with less emotional openness show no change in motivation. Finally, study 3 (n=250) assesses the novel construct of climate anger (i.e., anger that little is being done to preserve the biosphere), by examining how integrated (i.e., open, honest) emotion regulation relates to sustained climate action through constructive responding to one's climate anger and rage. Importantly, these three studies show that proactive interest in one's emotions is what drives these effects, rather than other competing predictors like motivational orientation or trait empathy. Taken together, results highlight that agentic and authentic emotional acceptance may be essential for sustaining high effort behavior aimed at tackling injustice. Symposium Talk 2: Title and Abstract Empathize with The Enemy: Emotion Regulation, Empathy, and Support for Pacifying Policies in Intractable Conflicts. Negative emotions often impede the resolution of intractable intergroup conflicts, making their adaptive regulation essential for reconciliation. Integrative emotion regulation (IER), which entails actively engaging with one's negative emotions, holds promise due to its demonstrated connection to empathy and support for conciliatory policies in the context of the Middle East conflict. However, prior work did not test whether the links hold when negative emotions related to the conflict are elicited. We conducted three experiments with Jewish-Israelis to test these links, focusing on participants' reactions to adversities of Palestinians. In the first two, we compared a negative emotion condition (Study 1: fear; N=240; Study 2: anger, N=293) to a neutral control condition. Our findings replicated positive relations between IER, empathy, and support for conciliatory policies even when negative emotions were elicited.

Thus, consistent with the core SDT distinction between controlled and autonomous behavioral regulation, emotional integration represents an autonomous form of regulation, contrasting with defensive suppression or stifling of emotional experiences. This symposium will provide deeper insights into the outcomes of emotional integration and the processes that underpin its benefits in different contexts that may elicit intense negative emotions. The first talk presents three studies examining the effects of emotional integration on social justice.

Symposium Talk 1: Title and Abstract The Importance of Emotional Openness in Social Action  People vary in the degree to which they acknowledge and take interest in their emotions as opposed to ignoring or suppressing them. Although integrative emotion regulation has proven important for both psychological wellbeing and prosocial behavior, relatively less is known about its role in behaviors related to social justice. Because campaigning for social justice is arduous, often requiring sustained confrontation of social structures of power, it requires highly motivated, flexible, and constructive emotional regulation. Being open to and accepting one's emotional experience is necessary for preserving and regulating emotion in constructive and assertive ways. This talk examines the critical function of emotional openness in two important domains of social action – antiracism and climate activism. Study 1 (n=440) examines the role of emotional openness in antiracism and social justice behaviors, revealing that it explains more variance in these outcomes than do other known predictors of prejudice. In study 2 (n=260), those with more active interest in their own emotions show an increase in antiracist motivation after exposure to a confrontational antiracist message, whereas those with less emotional openness show no change in motivation. Finally, study 3 (n=250) assesses the novel construct of climate anger (i.e., anger that little is being done to preserve the biosphere), by examining how integrated (i.e., open, honest) emotion regulation relates to sustained climate action through constructive responding to one's climate anger and rage. Importantly, these three studies show that proactive interest in one's emotions is what drives these effects, rather than other competing predictors like motivational orientation or trait empathy. Taken together, results highlight that agentic and authentic emotional acceptance may be essential for sustaining high effort behavior aimed at tackling injustice. Symposium Talk 2: Title and Abstract Empathize with The Enemy: Emotion Regulation, Empathy, and Support for Pacifying Policies in Intractable Conflicts. Negative emotions often impede the resolution of intractable intergroup conflicts, making their adaptive regulation essential for reconciliation. Integrative emotion regulation (IER), which entails actively engaging with one's negative emotions, holds promise due to its demonstrated connection to empathy and support for conciliatory policies in the context of the Middle East conflict. However, prior work did not test whether the links hold when negative emotions related to the conflict are elicited. We conducted three experiments with Jewish-Israelis to test these links, focusing on participants' reactions to adversities of Palestinians. In the first two, we compared a negative emotion condition (Study 1: fear; N=240; Study 2: anger, N=293) to a neutral control condition. Our findings replicated positive relations between IER, empathy, and support for conciliatory policies even when negative emotions were elicited. In the third experiment, we also compared a fear condition to a neutral control condition (N=471; 50.5% women; mean age: 43.67; SD=12.92), but this time we tested the association between IER, empathy, and two types of victimhood beliefs. Exclusive victimhood beliefs involve a perception that the ingroup suffers much more than the outgroup, whereas inclusive victimhood beliefs involve the perception of mutual adversity. Past research has found the latter may promote support for conciliatory policies. The third experiment's findings replicated the positive relations between IER and empathy and showed empathy mediated the association between IER and inclusive victimhood regardless of emotion elicitation. These results support the assumption that showing interest in others' adversities is, to some extent, predicted by individuals' tendency to engage with their own negative emotions (i.e., IER). The findings are discussed in relation to prior research on emotion regulation in group contexts, including applications to conflict resolution. Symposium Talk 3: Title and Abstract The Impact of Goal Self-Concordance on Emotion Regulation during Academic Goal Pursuit: A Multilevel Latent Profile Analysis Approach Goal pursuit begins with setting a goal and continues with striving to attain the goal. Both stages are critical for the quality of the process. Research based on the self-concordance model (Sheldon &amp; Elliot, 1998) shows setting self-concordant goals—those aligned with one's values, interests, and ideals—facilitates goal pursuit. During goal striving, recent research suggests that emotion regulation strategies focused on engaging with emotions—either by taking an interest in them (i.e., emotional integration) or by reframing them (i.e., reappraisal)—facilitate goal pursuit, while emotional suppression impedes the process. Benita et al. (2023) have shown the quality of the goal-setting stage can significantly influence the quality of emotion regulation strategies used at goal striving. However, recent studies utilizing multilevel latent profile analysis (ML-LPA) (e.g., Grommisch et al., 2020) indicate that the quality of emotion regulation involves more than just the type of strategy. It also depends on the degree and consistency of strategy use. This study investigated how self-concordant goals influence the type, degree, and consistency of emotion regulation in goal pursuit. Using ML-LPA, we identified emotion regulation profiles and explored their role as mediators between goal self-concordance and goal pursuit outcomes. A sample of 366 undergraduates (77% female, M age = 20.04, SD = 1.49) participated in a daily diary study. Each morning, participants reported an academic goal and its self-concordance. Each evening, they reported their emotion regulation strategies for goal-related negative emotions and goal pursuit outcomes. We identified four day-level and five person-level profiles that varied in strategy type, degree, and consistency. Goal self-concordance predicted optimal outcomes by increasing the likelihood of profiles with engagement-type strategies (i.e. emotional integration and reappraisal) and high consistency while reducing profiles with low degree and inconsistency. This study advances understanding of the role of emotion regulation in motivating goal-directed behavior. Symposium Talk 4: Title and Abstract Emotion Regulation in Adults' Memories of Child Maltreatment: Implications for Mental Health Negative traumatic past events remain encoded in memories and recalling them is typically a difficult experience that requires emotion regulation strategies, even years after the event occurred. In this study, 1,000 adults (18 to 83, M = 42.3 years) recruited from the general population and who had experienced child maltreatment (physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; physical or emotional neglect; or witness of intimate partner abuse) before the age of 18 recalled a memory of one of their experiences of child maltreatment and another memory related to a traumatic or distressful event experienced as a child, but unrelated to child maltreatment (e.g., a car accident). For each of their two memories, participants indicated what type of emotion regulation strategies they still need to use when recalling those memories today—integrative regulation, amotivated regulation (dysregulation), or controlled regulation. Results of regression analyses showed that amotivated regulation in both types of memories positively and independently predicted current symptoms of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and suicidal intentions. The coefficient of the child maltreatment memory was double the size of the coefficient of the traumatic memory. Conversely, integrative regulation in each type of memories was negatively and independently associated with most of these symptoms, with coefficients of the same size. These results held after controlling for the intensity of child maltreatment (as measured by the Child Trauma Questionnaire) and general emotion regulation capacities and were not moderated by age groups (18 to 39 years old vs. 40 years and over). These results suggest that the way each single memory remains emotionally regulated matters in terms of mental health and captures variance that is independent of global capacities. Targeting specific traumatic memories may be a fruitful avenue for clinical interventions.  ","14:30","Symposium General Abstract Over the past 15 years, extensive research rooted in Self-Determination Theory (SDT) has highlighted the adaptive role of emotional integration for well-being and adaptive functioning across domains that often evoke negative emotions, such as close relationships, prosocial behavior, goal pursuit, and coping with academic failures. Emotional integration involves neither actively suppressing feelings nor quickly reframing appraisals to change what is felt. Instead, individuals receptively allow emotions and actively take an interest in their emotional experiences and their meaning. This approach enables them to make informed choices about subsequent actions, which may include either voluntarily expressing emotions and seeking emotional support from others or deliberately withholding them. Thus, consistent with the core SDT distinction between controlled and autonomous behavioral regulation, emotional integration represents an autonomous form of regulation, contrasting with defensive suppression or stifling of emotional experiences.

However, prior work did not test whether the links hold when negative emotions related to the conflict are elicited. We conducted three experiments with Jewish-Israelis to test these links, focusing on participants' reactions to adversities of Palestinians.

Symposium Talk 3: Title and Abstract The Impact of Goal Self-Concordance on Emotion Regulation during Academic Goal Pursuit: A Multilevel Latent Profile Analysis Approach Goal pursuit begins with setting a goal and continues with striving to attain the goal. Both stages are critical for the quality of the process. Research based on the self-concordance model (Sheldon &amp; Elliot, 1998) shows setting self-concordant goals—those aligned with one's values, interests, and ideals—facilitates goal pursuit. During goal striving, recent research suggests that emotion regulation strategies focused on engaging with emotions—either by taking an interest in them (i.e., emotional integration) or by reframing them (i.e., reappraisal)—facilitate goal pursuit, while emotional suppression impedes the process. Benita et al. (2023) have shown the quality of the goal-setting stage can significantly influence the quality of emotion regulation strategies used at goal striving. However, recent studies utilizing multilevel latent profile analysis (ML-LPA) (e.g., Grommisch et al., 2020) indicate that the quality of emotion regulation involves more than just the type of strategy. It also depends on the degree and consistency of strategy use. This study investigated how self-concordant goals influence the type, degree, and consistency of emotion regulation in goal pursuit. Using ML-LPA, we identified emotion regulation profiles and explored their role as mediators between goal self-concordance and goal pursuit outcomes. A sample of 366 undergraduates (77% female, M age = 20.04, SD = 1.49) participated in a daily diary study. Each morning, participants reported an academic goal and its self-concordance. Each evening, they reported their emotion regulation strategies for goal-related negative emotions and goal pursuit outcomes. We identified four day-level and five person-level profiles that varied in strategy type, degree, and consistency. Goal self-concordance predicted optimal outcomes by increasing the likelihood of profiles with engagement-type strategies (i.e. emotional integration and reappraisal) and high consistency while reducing profiles with low degree and inconsistency. This study advances understanding of the role of emotion regulation in motivating goal-directed behavior. Symposium Talk 4: Title and Abstract Emotion Regulation in Adults' Memories of Child Maltreatment: Implications for Mental Health Negative traumatic past events remain encoded in memories and recalling them is typically a difficult experience that requires emotion regulation strategies, even years after the event occurred. In this study, 1,000 adults (18 to 83, M = 42.3 years) recruited from the general population and who had experienced child maltreatment (physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; physical or emotional neglect; or witness of intimate partner abuse) before the age of 18 recalled a memory of one of their experiences of child maltreatment and another memory related to a traumatic or distressful event experienced as a child, but unrelated to child maltreatment (e.g., a car accident). For each of their two memories, participants indicated what type of emotion regulation strategies they still need to use when recalling those memories today—integrative regulation, amotivated regulation (dysregulation), or controlled regulation. Results of regression analyses showed that amotivated regulation in both types of memories positively and independently predicted current symptoms of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and suicidal intentions. The coefficient of the child maltreatment memory was double the size of the coefficient of the traumatic memory. Conversely, integrative regulation in each type of memories was negatively and independently associated with most of these symptoms, with coefficients of the same size. These results held after controlling for the intensity of child maltreatment (as measured by the Child Trauma Questionnaire) and general emotion regulation capacities and were not moderated by age groups (18 to 39 years old vs. 40 years and over). These results suggest that the way each single memory remains emotionally regulated matters in terms of mental health and captures variance that is independent of global capacities. Targeting specific traumatic memories may be a fruitful avenue for clinical interventions.  "]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr><\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"responsive":{"details":{"target":1}},"dom":"t","pageLength":-1,"ordering":false,"columnDefs":[{"name":"rowname","targets":0},{"name":"V1","targets":1},{"name":"V2","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[-1,10,25,50,100],"rowCallback":"function(row, data, displayNum, displayIndex, dataIndex) {\nvar value=data[0]; $(this.api().cell(row, 0).node()).css({'font-weight':'bold','color':'#eeeeee','background-color':'#E84E0F'});\n}"}},"evals":["options.rowCallback"],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
