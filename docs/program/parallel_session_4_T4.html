Most studies have focused on the perception of others' emotions but less is known about emotion production. This is especially true in developmental research, where much work has examined infants' processing of emotional expressions and children's understanding of, and reasoning about emotions. Recently, efforts have shifted toward understanding how emotions are produced through facial and bodily expressions as well as physiological reactions across development. This symposium brings together studies from different European labs that reflect recent efforts to advance our understanding of emotion production across development. First, Zeynep Suata and Sam Wass examine developmental changes in infant negative affect (facial and vocal) from 6 to 12 months. Using a toy retraction, they measure momentary emotional expressions, physiological reactivity, and their temporal associations. Second, Julia Folz and colleagues evoke stress in caregivers and investigate whether young children's positive and negative affect, indexed through facial expression and physiological reactions, is influenced by caregivers' stress and differs across early development. Third, Clemens von Wulffen and colleagues compare how 5- to 12-year-old children and adults represent self-conscious and basic emotions through facial expressions, body posture, and situational context in their drawings of emotions. Fourth, Chris Riddell and colleagues evoke emotions (fear, sadness, joy, disgust) using validated videos in Dutch and Japanese 8-12-year-old children and adults and compare facial expressions across age and culture. Finally, Evin Aktar and colleagues examine whether parental verbal threat (versus safety) affects adolescents' (10-14 years old) fear and anxiety, indexed through behavioral and physiological measures during social performance. In sum, the key aim of this symposium is to demonstrate how studying children of different ages, in diverse contexts, and using multiple measures to index distinct emotions, provides rich and novel insights into how and why emotions are expressed throughout development. Individual abstracts Developmental changes in infant affect dynamics during an emotion-eliciting task Zeynep M. Suata1,4, Kasia Kostyrka-Allchorne2, Sam V. Wass3, Edmund Sonuga-Barke4 1Middle East Technical University, 2Queen Mary University of London,3University of East London, 4King's College London Developmental theories of emotion propose that negative affect decreases over time as attention control and emotion regulation improve. Yet, research on infancy suggests that the first year of life can be characterised by a different developmental pattern: increased negative affect as infants age. Implementing an emotion-eliciting task, we measured infants' negative affect, emotion regulation, and physiological reactivity during challenge (toy retraction) and recovery (toy play) conditions at 6 months (n=82, 43 boys) and 12 months (n=68, 36 boys) on a second-by-second basis. In addition to mean intensity, we calculated variability (variance), lability (root mean square of successive differences), and persistence (autocorrelation) of these measures. Intensity, variability, and lability of negative affect increased from 6 to 12 months, with no change in persistence, indicating greater and faster shifts in negative affect with age. Emotion regulation also increased, but only during the challenge. Physiological reactivity, measured by heart rate, decreased from challenge to recovery at 12 months but not at 6 months. Finally, cross-correlation analyses revealed stronger concurrent associations between negative affect, regulation, and heart rate at 12 months, suggesting increased temporal synchrony between emotional and physiological responses with age. We discuss these developmental changes in affect dynamics and emotion-physiology associations in the context of functionalist perspectives on emotion.  Affect dynamics during social interactions in early childhood: The role of maternal stress Julia Folz, Vanessa van Ast, &amp; Milica Nikolic, University of Amsterdam In the first months of life, infants highly depend on their caregivers to recognize and fulfill their basic needs. With language not being (fully) developed yet in early childhood, communication with caregivers mainly takes place non-verbally. Here, facial expressions of affect play an important role in reflecting the infant's emotional state as well as in affiliating with the caregiver. Further, indicators of physiological arousal can provide insights in the infant's affect dynamics during social interactions. Importantly, changes in infant affect are not only elicited by internal processes but are also highly susceptible to environmental factors. Previous research has highlighted the role of maternal stress in influencing infants' affective states and their expression, in line with a bi-directional affective attunement in mother-infant interactions. In the current study, we observed how inducing stress in the mother shaped the expression of facial affect as well as cardiovascular arousal in 6-36 months-old infants. More specifically, we measured the infants' heart rates during a 2-minute face-to-face interaction with their mother, while we elicited stress in the mother using a 2-minute arithmetic task, and then again during a 2-minute face-to-face interaction just after the stress induction. Preliminary results (N=25) show that children's negative but not positive affect during post compared to pre-stress social interaction is significantly influenced by caregivers' stress. Visual production of emotions: A drawing and rating study. Clemens von Wulffen, Asifa Majid, &amp; Robert Hepach, Oxford University The relative influence of facial expressions and contextual information on emotion inference has been an enduring focus within affective sciences (Leitzke &amp; Pollak, 2016). The current set of studies aims to contribute to this literature by examining how visual representations of \"self-conscious\" and \"basic\" emotions change across development. Our studies are motivated by prior work investigating children's expressions of emotions via drawing (Bonoti &amp; Misalidi, 2015; Brechet et al., 2007, 2009). Here, we investigated how adults and children include information on facial expressions, body posture, and situational context in their drawings of emotions. In a completed, preregistered Study 1 (https://osf.io/w67se/), adults (N = 30, 18 female, Mage = 26.9 years, SD = 7.1) created 10 drawings on a custom-coded digital interface, representing 5 basic emotions = happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust; and 5 self-conscious emotions = pride, shame, embarrassment, guilt, and jealousy. The dependent measures of interested included (1) content of the drawings, (2) ratings of visual imagery for each emotion, and (3) pixel quantity, time spent drawing, and perceived drawing difficulty. The results showed a significant effect of emotion type (self-conscious vs. basic), with self-conscious emotions being less likely to be depicted by only facial features compared to basic emotions (OR = 0.26, 95% CI [0.07, 0.97], p = .045, see Fig. 1. A). Self-conscious emotions were also rated with significantly lower visual imagery scores than basic emotions (β = -17.74, 95% CI [-28.21, -7.26], p = .001, see Fig. 1. C.). Building on this, we are currently planning two studies, one with adults and one with children aged 5-12 to analyse the developmental changes in emotion depiction and visual imagery ratings. We will discuss our results in light of recent theories on emotional development which highlight the significance of self-conscious emotions for early child development. Cross-cultural emotions reconsidered: the spontaneous production of emotions across age in Japan and the Netherlands Christopher Riddell1,2 Tom Roth3, Hisako Yamamoto4, Akihiro Tanaka4, Mariska Kret1,2, Milica Nikolic5 1Leiden University, 2Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition (LIBC), 3Utrecht University, 4Tokyo Woman's Christian University, 5University of Amsterdam Many attempts have been made to examine the commonalities and differences in the ways that emotions are expressed across human cultures. However, typically, this question has been investigated by asking adults to pose certain facial expressions, which often results in intense and stereotyped displays. These posed stimuli are then typically used in research on emotion perception, but research on spontaneous emotion production is extremely limited. It remains unknown whether the emotional expressions that humans produce in daily life are expressed universally across cultures and ages. In this study, we examined how N = 140 children (aged 8-12-years-old) and adults in Japan and the Netherlands experienced and expressed spontaneously evoked emotions. To this end, we induced emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, and fear through validated videos, while recording participants' facial expressions and self-reported emotional experience. Our results show that all participants reported feeling similar levels of emotions while viewing the video stimuli. However, Japanese participants showed lower intensity facial expressions of emotion compared to Dutch participants overall, and this effect was driven by lower intensity displays in Japanese adults compared to Dutch adults. Japanese and Dutch children, rather, were more similar in the intensity of their emotional expressions. This suggests that emotions may have more in common across cultures early in ontogeny and that cultural norms and social learning might play an important role in shaping how emotions come to be expressed across human development. Parent‐to‐child transmission of stranger anxiety via verbal information Evin Aktar1, Cosima A. Nimphy1, Koraly Pérez‐Edgar2 1Leiden University, 2Pennsylvania State University Anxiety runs in families. Parents contribute to their children's fears through social learning by modeling anxious responses and/or verbally communicating threat information about new stimuli. A recent meta-analysis has shown a medium-sized causal effect of parents' verbal threat information on children's fear acquisition of new stimuli between the ages of 2.5 and 183. This synthesis of previous research on children's fear acquisition through verbal learning from parents also revealed that the available empirical evidence predominantly focused on non-social novel stimuli (such as unfamiliar objects and animals). To address this gap, the current study examined the effect of parental verbal threat (as opposed to safety) information about strangers and its impact on acquiring social fears during adolescence, a vulnerable period for developing these fears. A sample of 77 children aged 10 to 14 and their primary caregivers participated in this experimental study. Parents were trained to provide verbal information about two strangers: one was associated with threats, while the other was linked to safety information. Following this, children completed a social performance task twice (with each of the two strangers). They delivered a 2.5-minute speech on shyness and confidence, while their fear reactions were recorded through behavioral (observed fear and avoidance), physiological (heart rate), and cognitive (attention to strangers and perceived performance) indices of fear during the task. In our presentation, we will focus on the causal influence of parental verbal information on children's fear indices and explore the concordance between these indices."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr><\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"responsive":{"details":{"target":1}},"dom":"t","pageLength":-1,"ordering":false,"columnDefs":[{"name":"rowname","targets":0},{"name":"V1","targets":1}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[-1,10,25,50,100],"rowCallback":"function(row, data, displayNum, displayIndex, dataIndex) {\nvar value=data[0]; $(this.api().cell(row, 0).node()).css({'font-weight':'bold','color':'#eeeeee','background-color':'#E84E0F'});\n}"}},"evals":["options.rowCallback"],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

In the current study, we observed how inducing stress in the mother shaped the expression of facial affect as well as cardiovascular arousal in 6-36 months-old infants. More specifically, we measured the infants' heart rates during a 2-minute face-to-face interaction with their mother, while we elicited stress in the mother using a 2-minute arithmetic task, and then again during a 2-minute face-to-face interaction just after the stress induction. Preliminary results (N=25) show that children's negative but not positive affect during post compared to pre-stress social interaction is significantly influenced by caregivers' stress. Visual production of emotions: A drawing and rating study. Clemens von Wulffen, Asifa Majid, &amp; Robert Hepach, Oxford University The relative influence of facial expressions and contextual information on emotion inference has been an enduring focus within affective sciences (Leitzke &amp; Pollak, 2016). The current set of studies aims to contribute to this literature by examining how visual representations of \"self-conscious\" and \"basic\" emotions change across development. Our studies are motivated by prior work investigating children's expressions of emotions via drawing (Bonoti &amp; Misalidi, 2015; Brechet et al., 2007, 2009). Here, we investigated how adults and children include information on facial expressions, body posture, and situational context in their drawings of emotions. In a completed, preregistered Study 1 (https://osf.io/w67se/), adults (N = 30, 18 female, Mage = 26.9 years, SD = 7.1) created 10 drawings on a custom-coded digital interface, representing 5 basic emotions = happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust; and 5 self-conscious emotions = pride, shame, embarrassment, guilt, and jealousy. The dependent measures of interested included (1) content of the drawings, (2) ratings of visual imagery for each emotion, and (3) pixel quantity, time spent drawing, and perceived drawing difficulty. The results showed a significant effect of emotion type (self-conscious vs. basic), with self-conscious emotions being less likely to be depicted by only facial features compared to basic emotions (OR = 0.26, 95% CI [0.07, 0.97], p = .045, see Fig. 1. A). Self-conscious emotions were also rated with significantly lower visual imagery scores than basic emotions (β = -17.74, 95% CI [-28.21, -7.26], p = .001, see Fig. 1. C.). Building on this, we are currently planning two studies, one with adults and one with children aged 5-12 to analyse the developmental changes in emotion depiction and visual imagery ratings. We will discuss our results in light of recent theories on emotional development which highlight the significance of self-conscious emotions for early child development. Cross-cultural emotions reconsidered: the spontaneous production of emotions across age in Japan and the Netherlands Christopher Riddell1,2 Tom Roth3, Hisako Yamamoto4, Akihiro Tanaka4, Mariska Kret1,2, Milica Nikolic5 1Leiden University, 2Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition (LIBC), 3Utrecht University, 4Tokyo Woman's Christian University, 5University of Amsterdam Many attempts have been made to examine the commonalities and differences in the ways that emotions are expressed across human cultures. However, typically, this question has been investigated by asking adults to pose certain facial expressions, which often results in intense and stereotyped displays. These posed stimuli are then typically used in research on emotion perception, but research on spontaneous emotion production is extremely limited. It remains unknown whether the emotional expressions that humans produce in daily life are expressed universally across cultures and ages. In this study, we examined how N = 140 children (aged 8-12-years-old) and adults in Japan and the Netherlands experienced and expressed spontaneously evoked emotions. To this end, we induced emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, and fear through validated videos, while recording participants' facial expressions and self-reported emotional experience. Our results show that all participants reported feeling similar levels of emotions while viewing the video stimuli. However, Japanese participants showed lower intensity facial expressions of emotion compared to Dutch participants overall, and this effect was driven by lower intensity displays in Japanese adults compared to Dutch adults. Japanese and Dutch children, rather, were more similar in the intensity of their emotional expressions. This suggests that emotions may have more in common across cultures early in ontogeny and that cultural norms and social learning might play an important role in shaping how emotions come to be expressed across human development. Parent‐to‐child transmission of stranger anxiety via verbal information Evin Aktar1, Cosima A. Nimphy1, Koraly Pérez‐Edgar2 1Leiden University, 2Pennsylvania State University Anxiety runs in families. Parents contribute to their children's fears through social learning by modeling anxious responses and/or verbally communicating threat information about new stimuli. A recent meta-analysis has shown a medium-sized causal effect of parents' verbal threat information on children's fear acquisition of new stimuli between the ages of 2.5 and 183. This synthesis of previous research on children's fear acquisition through verbal learning from parents also revealed that the available empirical evidence predominantly focused on non-social novel stimuli (such as unfamiliar objects and animals). To address this gap, the current study examined the effect of parental verbal threat (as opposed to safety) information about strangers and its impact on acquiring social fears during adolescence, a vulnerable period for developing these fears. A sample of 77 children aged 10 to 14 and their primary caregivers participated in this experimental study. Parents were trained to provide verbal information about two strangers: one was associated with threats, while the other was linked to safety information. Following this, children completed a social performance task twice (with each of the two strangers). They delivered a 2.5-minute speech on shyness and confidence, while their fear reactions were recorded through behavioral (observed fear and avoidance), physiological (heart rate), and cognitive (attention to strangers and perceived performance) indices of fear during the task. In our presentation, we will focus on the causal influence of parental verbal information on children's fear indices and explore the concordance between these indices.","11:15","Research on emotion expression has blossomed in the past decades. Most studies have focused on the perception of others' emotions but less is known about emotion production. This is especially true in developmental research, where much work has examined infants' processing of emotional expressions and children's understanding of, and reasoning about emotions. Recently, efforts have shifted toward understanding how emotions are produced through facial and bodily expressions as well as physiological reactions across development. This symposium brings together studies from different European labs that reflect recent efforts to advance our understanding of emotion production across development. First, Zeynep Suata and Sam Wass examine developmental changes in infant negative affect (facial and vocal) from 6 to 12 months. Using a toy retraction, they measure momentary emotional expressions, physiological reactivity, and their temporal associations. Second, Julia Folz and colleagues evoke stress in caregivers and investigate whether young children's positive and negative affect, indexed through facial expression and physiological reactions, is influenced by caregivers' stress and differs across early development. Third, Clemens von Wulffen and colleagues compare how 5- to 12-year-old children and adults represent self-conscious and basic emotions through facial expressions, body posture, and situational context in their drawings of emotions. Fourth, Chris Riddell and colleagues evoke emotions (fear, sadness, joy, disgust) using validated videos in Dutch and Japanese 8-12-year-old children and adults and compare facial expressions across age and culture. Finally, Evin Aktar and colleagues examine whether parental verbal threat (versus safety) affects adolescents' (10-14 years old) fear and anxiety, indexed through behavioral and physiological measures during social performance. In sum, the key aim of this symposium is to demonstrate how studying children of different ages, in diverse contexts, and using multiple measures to index distinct emotions, provides rich and novel insights into how and why emotions are expressed throughout development. Individual abstracts Developmental changes in infant affect dynamics during an emotion-eliciting task Zeynep M. Suata1,4, Kasia Kostyrka-Allchorne2, Sam V. Wass3, Edmund Sonuga-Barke4 1Middle East Technical University, 2Queen Mary University of London,3University of East London, 4King's College London Developmental theories of emotion propose that negative affect decreases over time as attention control and emotion regulation improve. Yet, research on infancy suggests that the first year of life can be characterised by a different developmental pattern: increased negative affect as infants age. Implementing an emotion-eliciting task, we measured infants' negative affect, emotion regulation, and physiological reactivity during challenge (toy retraction) and recovery (toy play) conditions at 6 months (n=82, 43 boys) and 12 months (n=68, 36 boys) on a second-by-second basis. In addition to mean intensity, we calculated variability (variance), lability (root mean square of successive differences), and persistence (autocorrelation) of these measures. Intensity, variability, and lability of negative affect increased from 6 to 12 months, with no change in persistence, indicating greater and faster shifts in negative affect with age. Emotion regulation also increased, but only during the challenge. Physiological reactivity, measured by heart rate, decreased from challenge to recovery at 12 months but not at 6 months. Finally, cross-correlation analyses revealed stronger concurrent associations between negative affect, regulation, and heart rate at 12 months, suggesting increased temporal synchrony between emotional and physiological responses with age. We discuss these developmental changes in affect dynamics and emotion-physiology associations in the context of functionalist perspectives on emotion.  Affect dynamics during social interactions in early childhood: The role of maternal stress Julia Folz, Vanessa van Ast, &amp; Milica Nikolic, University of Amsterdam In the first months of life, infants highly depend on their caregivers to recognize and fulfill their basic needs. With language not being (fully) developed yet in early childhood, communication with caregivers mainly takes place non-verbally. Here, facial expressions of affect play an important role in reflecting the infant's emotional state as well as in affiliating with the caregiver. Further, indicators of physiological arousal can provide insights in the infant's affect dynamics during social interactions. Importantly, changes in infant affect are not only elicited by internal processes but are also highly susceptible to environmental factors.

It remains unknown whether the emotional expressions that humans produce in daily life are expressed universally across cultures and ages. In this study, we examined how N = 140 children (aged 8-12-years-old) and adults in Japan and the Netherlands experienced and expressed spontaneously evoked emotions. To this end, we induced emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, and fear through validated videos, while recording participants' facial expressions and self-reported emotional experience. Our results show that all participants reported feeling similar levels of emotions while viewing the video stimuli. However, Japanese participants showed lower intensity facial expressions of emotion compared to Dutch participants overall, and this effect was driven by lower intensity displays in Japanese adults compared to Dutch adults. Japanese and Dutch children, rather, were more similar in the intensity of their emotional expressions. This suggests that emotions may have more in common across cultures early in ontogeny and that cultural norms and social learning might play an important role in shaping how emotions come to be expressed across human development. Parent‐to‐child transmission of stranger anxiety via verbal information Evin Aktar1, Cosima A. Nimphy1, Koraly Pérez‐Edgar2 1Leiden University, 2Pennsylvania State University Anxiety runs in families. Parents contribute to their children's fears through social learning by modeling anxious responses and/or verbally communicating threat information about new stimuli. A recent meta-analysis has shown a medium-sized causal effect of parents' verbal threat information on children's fear acquisition of new stimuli between the ages of 2.5 and 183. This synthesis of previous research on children's fear acquisition through verbal learning from parents also revealed that the available empirical evidence predominantly focused on non-social novel stimuli (such as unfamiliar objects and animals). To address this gap, the current study examined the effect of parental verbal threat (as opposed to safety) information about strangers and its impact on acquiring social fears during adolescence, a vulnerable period for developing these fears. A sample of 77 children aged 10 to 14 and their primary caregivers participated in this experimental study. Parents were trained to provide verbal information about two strangers: one was associated with threats, while the other was linked to safety information. Following this, children completed a social performance task twice (with each of the two strangers). They delivered a 2.5-minute speech on shyness and confidence, while their fear reactions were recorded through behavioral (observed fear and avoidance), physiological (heart rate), and cognitive (attention to strangers and perceived performance) indices of fear during the task. In our presentation, we will focus on the causal influence of parental verbal information on children's fear indices and explore the concordance between these indices.","12:00","Research on emotion expression has blossomed in the past decades. Most studies have focused on the perception of others' emotions but less is known about emotion production. This is especially true in developmental research, where much work has examined infants' processing of emotional expressions and children's understanding of, and reasoning about emotions. Recently, efforts have shifted toward understanding how emotions are produced through facial and bodily expressions as well as physiological reactions across development. This symposium brings together studies from different European labs that reflect recent efforts to advance our understanding of emotion production across development. First, Zeynep Suata and Sam Wass examine developmental changes in infant negative affect (facial and vocal) from 6 to 12 months. Using a toy retraction, they measure momentary emotional expressions, physiological reactivity, and their temporal associations. Second, Julia Folz and colleagues evoke stress in caregivers and investigate whether young children's positive and negative affect, indexed through facial expression and physiological reactions, is influenced by caregivers' stress and differs across early development. Third, Clemens von Wulffen and colleagues compare how 5- to 12-year-old children and adults represent self-conscious and basic emotions through facial expressions, body posture, and situational context in their drawings of emotions. Fourth, Chris Riddell and colleagues evoke emotions (fear, sadness, joy, disgust) using validated videos in Dutch and Japanese 8-12-year-old children and adults and compare facial expressions across age and culture. Finally, Evin Aktar and colleagues examine whether parental verbal threat (versus safety) affects adolescents' (10-14 years old) fear and anxiety, indexed through behavioral and physiological measures during social performance. In sum, the key aim of this symposium is to demonstrate how studying children of different ages, in diverse contexts, and using multiple measures to index distinct emotions, provides rich and novel insights into how and why emotions are expressed throughout development. Individual abstracts Developmental changes in infant affect dynamics during an emotion-eliciting task Zeynep M. Suata1,4, Kasia Kostyrka-Allchorne2, Sam V. Wass3, Edmund Sonuga-Barke4 1Middle East Technical University, 2Queen Mary University of London,3University of East London, 4King's College London Developmental theories of emotion propose that negative affect decreases over time as attention control and emotion regulation improve. Yet, research on infancy suggests that the first year of life can be characterised by a different developmental pattern: increased negative affect as infants age. Implementing an emotion-eliciting task, we measured infants' negative affect, emotion regulation, and physiological reactivity during challenge (toy retraction) and recovery (toy play) conditions at 6 months (n=82, 43 boys) and 12 months (n=68, 36 boys) on a second-by-second basis. In addition to mean intensity, we calculated variability (variance), lability (root mean square of successive differences), and persistence (autocorrelation) of these measures. Intensity, variability, and lability of negative affect increased from 6 to 12 months, with no change in persistence, indicating greater and faster shifts in negative affect with age. Emotion regulation also increased, but only during the challenge. Physiological reactivity, measured by heart rate, decreased from challenge to recovery at 12 months but not at 6 months. Finally, cross-correlation analyses revealed stronger concurrent associations between negative affect, regulation, and heart rate at 12 months, suggesting increased temporal synchrony between emotional and physiological responses with age. We discuss these developmental changes in affect dynamics and emotion-physiology associations in the context of functionalist perspectives on emotion.  Affect dynamics during social interactions in early childhood: The role of maternal stress Julia Folz, Vanessa van Ast, &amp; Milica Nikolic, University of Amsterdam In the first months of life, infants highly depend on their caregivers to recognize and fulfill their basic needs. With language not being (fully) developed yet in early childhood, communication with caregivers mainly takes place non-verbally. Here, facial expressions of affect play an important role in reflecting the infant's emotional state as well as in affiliating with the caregiver. Further, indicators of physiological arousal can provide insights in the infant's affect dynamics during social interactions. Importantly, changes in infant affect are not only elicited by internal processes but are also highly susceptible to environmental factors. Previous research has highlighted the role of maternal stress in influencing infants' affective states and their expression, in line with a bi-directional affective attunement in mother-infant interactions. In the current study, we observed how inducing stress in the mother shaped the expression of facial affect as well as cardiovascular arousal in 6-36 months-old infants. More specifically, we measured the infants' heart rates during a 2-minute face-to-face interaction with their mother, while we elicited stress in the mother using a 2-minute arithmetic task, and then again during a 2-minute face-to-face interaction just after the stress induction. Preliminary results (N=25) show that children's negative but not positive affect during post compared to pre-stress social interaction is significantly influenced by caregivers' stress. Visual production of emotions: A drawing and rating study. Clemens von Wulffen, Asifa Majid, &amp; Robert Hepach, Oxford University The relative influence of facial expressions and contextual information on emotion inference has been an enduring focus within affective sciences (Leitzke &amp; Pollak, 2016). The current set of studies aims to contribute to this literature by examining how visual representations of \"self-conscious\" and \"basic\" emotions change across development. Our studies are motivated by prior work investigating children's expressions of emotions via drawing (Bonoti &amp; Misalidi, 2015; Brechet et al., 2007, 2009). Here, we investigated how adults and children include information on facial expressions, body posture, and situational context in their drawings of emotions. In a completed, preregistered Study 1 (https://osf.io/w67se/), adults (N = 30, 18 female, Mage = 26.9 years, SD = 7.1) created 10 drawings on a custom-coded digital interface, representing 5 basic emotions = happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust; and 5 self-conscious emotions = pride, shame, embarrassment, guilt, and jealousy. The dependent measures of interested included (1) content of the drawings, (2) ratings of visual imagery for each emotion, and (3) pixel quantity, time spent drawing, and perceived drawing difficulty. The results showed a significant effect of emotion type (self-conscious vs. basic), with self-conscious emotions being less likely to be depicted by only facial features compared to basic emotions (OR = 0.26, 95% CI [0.07, 0.97], p = .045, see Fig. 1. A). Self-conscious emotions were also rated with significantly lower visual imagery scores than basic emotions (β = -17.74, 95% CI [-28.21, -7.26], p = .001, see Fig. 1. C.). Building on this, we are currently planning two studies, one with adults and one with children aged 5-12 to analyse the developmental changes in emotion depiction and visual imagery ratings. We will discuss our results in light of recent theories on emotional development which highlight the significance of self-conscious emotions for early child development. Cross-cultural emotions reconsidered: the spontaneous production of emotions across age in Japan and the Netherlands Christopher Riddell1,2 Tom Roth3, Hisako Yamamoto4, Akihiro Tanaka4, Mariska Kret1,2, Milica Nikolic5 1Leiden University, 2Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition (LIBC), 3Utrecht University, 4Tokyo Woman's Christian University, 5University of Amsterdam Many attempts have been made to examine the commonalities and differences in the ways that emotions are expressed across human cultures. However, typically, this question has been investigated by asking adults to pose certain facial expressions, which often results in intense and stereotyped displays. These posed stimuli are then typically used in research on emotion perception, but research on spontaneous emotion production is extremely limited. It remains unknown whether the emotional expressions that humans produce in daily life are expressed universally across cultures and ages.
