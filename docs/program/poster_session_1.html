In this context, very recently, the concept of integrative emotion regulation (IER), which represents an open and accepting attitude towards emotional experiences and utilization of these experiences to guide behavior (Roth et al., 2019), has been proposed as an adaptive ER mode, grounded in Self-Determination Theory's organismic metatheory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 2012). However, research on IER is still in its infancy and, to our knowledge, there is no such study, especially in a Turkish sample. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the role of IER offered by SDT on a Turkish adult sample. Specifically, the research examined the relationship between IER and psychological well-being and the role of basic psychological needs satisfaction, namely autonomy, competence, and relatedness satisfaction, on this relationship as proposed by the SDT perspective. 250 participants completed an online survey including a demographic information form and questionnaires assessing the study variables. Pearson's correlation was used to examine correlations between variables of interest. Mediation analyses were performed using Jamovi's medmod module based on bootstrapping with 1000 bias-corrected and accelerated resamples. The findings indicated that IER use was positively correlated with psychological well-being, satisfaction of autonomy, competence and relatedness, and negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Mediation analysis demonstrated that autonomy satisfaction fully mediated, while competence satisfaction partially mediated the association between IER and psychological well-being. Relatedness satisfaction was not found to have a mediator role.  The findings support the adaptive role of IER on psychological health and the role of psychological need satisfaction as an underlying mechanism between ER processes and psychological health. ","The past two decades have witnessed significant growth in emotion regulation research, yet the practical implementation of regulation strategies in everyday life remains comparatively underexplored. This study introduces the concept of \"ante-ebullition intervention\" (AEI) to investigate the critical moments preceding negative emotional escalation. We hypothesize that specific factors occurring just before an emotional shift significantly influence the subsequent expression and experience of emotions. The proposed study aims to identify and analyze the internal processes that occur during AEI, including changes in internal dialogue, physiological markers, and cognitive processes such as attention and perception shifts. By focusing on these pre-outburst moments, we seek to uncover potential intervention points for more effective emotion regulation. Our mixed-methods approach will combine physiological measurements, self-report questionnaires, and qualitative interviews. Participants (N = 150) will be monitored during induced emotional scenarios, with particular attention to the moments preceding emotional intensification. Data analysis will involve both quantitative statistical methods and qualitative thematic analysis to identify patterns and potential intervention strategies. We anticipate that this study will reveal distinct patterns of internal processes during AEI, providing insights into early intervention possibilities. These findings would have significant implications for developing more targeted and effective emotion regulation techniques, improving individuals' ability to manage emotions in real-time. This research contributes to the broader fields of emotion regulation and positive psychology, offering a new perspective on the micro-processes of emotional experiences. By focusing on the understudied pre-outburst phase, this work aims to enhance our understanding of emotion regulation and its practical applications in promoting well-being and psychological flourishing.","Emotion regulation (ER) is essential for mental health and well-being, yet individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs) face unique challenges in this domain. Many individuals with NDCs require lifelong caregiver support for ER, emphasizing the importance of interpersonal ER strategies. Identifying effective interpersonal ER strategies is crucial for improving support systems, enhancing parent-child relationships, and fostering emotional development in children with NDCs. Further, gaining insights into the profiles of interpersonal ER strategies can inform family interventions and educational practices, providing tools to navigate the challenges of co-regulating a neurodivergent child. Unfortunately, despite its significance, little is known about the strategies caregivers use or their effectiveness, particularly across diverse NDCs. This study addresses this important gap and provide a comprehensive characterization of caregivers' interpersonal ER practices by employing a participatory framework. Guided by a parent advisory committee, the study ensures inclusivity and relevance. Parents will contribute to refining the research design, ensuring cultural and contextual alignment with their lived experiences. Identifying effective interpersonal ER strategies is crucial for improving support systems, enhancing parent-child relationships, and fostering emotional development in children with NDCs. These findings could inform family interventions and educational practices, providing tools to navigate the challenges of co-regulating a neurodivergent child. We used a participatory qualitative approach, integrating focus groups and semi-structured individual interviews with parents of children aged 7–17 years. Focus groups will explore shared challenges and common interpersonal ER strategies, while individual interviews will provide detailed insights into the contextual factors influencing ER strategy effectiveness and frequency. All data will undergo reflexive thematic analysis using the six-phase framework of Braun and Clarke (2006). Themes will be coded into themes and subthemes to identify patterns, with additional team discussions to ensure rigor and minimize bias. The preliminary results of the focus group and a few individual interviews will be presented through visual data graphs generated with Atlas software. By exploring interpersonal ER strategies through focus groups and individual interviews, this study bridges knowledge gaps, offering evidence-based solutions to support families and improve outcomes for children with NDCs.","Recent studies have shown that games with high visuospatial demands, such as Tetris, can reduce the frequency of negative memories and influence emotional states. However, this effect has been explored only on samples with PTSD (Lyadurai et al., 2018). The potential for this effect to be preserved in a healthy sample has not been examined. The aim of our study was to investigate the possibility that computer games with high visuospatial demands, can neutralize the impact of negative affect on the recall of emotionally charged words (Bower, 1981; Rinck et al., 1992; Forgas, 1991; Fiedler, 1988) in a healthy sample. This is based on the ability of such tasks to selectively disrupt sensory aspects of memory through competition for limited cognitive resources, as noted in previous research (Baddeley, 2000), (Kavanagh, 2001). In this study, two groups of participants (n=54) were induced into a negative emotional state after they were required to memorize a set of 10 words. However, before this task, one group had to take a 10-minute break to play Tetris. We found significant differences in the recall of words (p = 0.011, p < 0.05), with the Tetris-intervention group showing better results compared to the non-intervention group. We can conclude that there is a small difference in the recall of words between the two experimental groups. However, the positive effect of the Tetris video game on the results was minimal. We conclude that further research is necessary to more accurately determine the potential influence of this factor. Keywords: negative emotional state, induction of emotions, emotional regulation, Tetris (video games), word recall.  ","Social anxiety, where people often avoid looking at faces in social situations, may be one of the reasons contributing to individual differences in face perception. Thus, the reported study explores how social anxiety relates to both facial identity and facial expression recognition ability in the same individual.  Participants (n = 144) were recruited from the University of Manchester and via Prolific. The online experiment included the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and face recognition tasks including the Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT), Glasgow Face Matching Test (GFMT) and a facial expression recognition test (dynamic faces). A significant negative correlation was observed between social anxiety and facial identity recognition (r = -0.226, n = 144, p = 0.006). However, no significant relationship was found between social anxiety and facial expression recognition (rho = -0.04, n = 144, p = 0.628). Participants were divided into into a low social anxiety group (n = 77) and a high social anxiety group (n = 67) based on the SIAS cutoff score of 36. In both groups, fear was the least accurately recognised emotion at low intensity (low social anxiety: mean = 1.39; high social anxiety: mean = 1.27) and high intensity (low social anxiety: mean = 2.56; high social anxiety: mean = 2.69) on a 4-point scale. In addition, according to categorisation biases, social anxiety levels was correlated with miscategorising surprise as sadness, anger as fear, and fear as disgust among low-intensity facial expressions. Our findings indicate that participants with higher levels of social anxiety are more likely to exhibit impairments in recognising facial identity compared to facial expressions. Additionally, they demonstrate difficulties in recognising fear specifically.","The visual system enables us to quickly recognize different facial expressions despite the high complexity of human faces. This impressive ability to perceive emotions can be biased by social anxiety which might lead to the overestimation of social threat. However, it is still under consideration how state anxiety influences our ability to process information about multiple faces. The current study aims to examine whether state anxiety affects the perception of face ensembles amplifying the perceived intensity of their average negative emotional expressions. We conducted an experiment with anxiety induction in order to analyze the accuracy and bias of participants' evaluations of emotional expressions in single faces and face ensembles with different intensity levels. The experiment included two sessions, the first without and the second with anxiety induction. In both sessions, participants performed an adjustment task for either a single face or face ensemble. The results indicated that anxious individuals overestimated the intensity of negative emotional expressions not only in the single face condition, but to a certain extent in the ensemble condition. However, this effect persists only at the low emotional intensity levels, disappearing at the high emotional intensity levels. We propose an explanation for the crowd amplification effect under anxiety based on a combinatorial interaction between two mechanisms. First, the noise-cancellation mechanism, which reduces the amount of noise involved in individual representations. Second, attention mechanism, which focuses cognitive resources on the most salient or emotionally intense elements in a crowd, thereby amplifying their perceived impact. Furthermore, we have shown that the crowd amplification effect in state anxiety stemmed from a systematic bias, rather than the impaired accuracy of emotion perception. Together, it provides valuable insights into the complexity of social communication between an individual and a group.","The extent to which faces and background influence emotion recognition remains unclear. Previous studies have focused exclusively on the significance of either the face or the background but have overlooked the role of emotion intensity (how strongly the emotion is expressed). Hence, this research aims to systematically investigate the role of emotion intensity (on face and/or background) on facial emotion recognition. We hypothesised that the relative contribution of face and background on emotion recognition fluctuates depending on emotion intensity. In Experiment 1, 103 participants were recruited online to identify happy, sad, and neutral facial expressions presented within positive, negative, and neutral backgrounds. Happy and sad faces were morphed to depict both high and low-intensity levels. Participants rated face emotion from -4 (strongly sad) to 4 (strongly happy). Results showed that background influenced emotion recognition when the face was ambiguous (i.e., low intensity). However, as face intensity increased, it became the dominant factor, diminishing the background's influence. Experiment 2 employed eye-tracking to examine mechanisms involved in face emotion recognition, while intensity and type of background varied. Background stimuli were static or dynamic (movies) in a between-participants design. As in Experiment 1, participants in Experiment 2 viewed backgrounds and then faces superimposed onto the background. They were asked to rate face emotions on a scale from -4 (strongly sad) to 4 (strongly happy). Preliminary analyses from Experiment 2 showed that intensity and type of background also affected gaze scan paths within facial regions, supporting and extending the behavioural effects from Experiment 1. Overall, the findings indicate that background intensity and type play an important role in face emotional recognition. Faces with low emotional intensity rely more on background for accurate emotion recognition, a reliance that is heightened in dynamic backgrounds.","People tend to automatically mimic one another's facial expressions - a phenomenon known as facial mimicry, widely regarded as important for understanding others' emotions. Although its importance is well documented, there has been little exploration of whether individuals' capacity to mimic predicts their capacity for emotion recognition. To test this, thirty-five participants completed three emotion recognition tasks: (i) a facial expression and emotion word congruency task; (ii) a slow-motion facial expression video task in which participants paused once they recognized the emotion; and (iii) Film task - a complex emotion-matching task. Moreover, participants took part in a mimicry task in which they were instructed to mimic actors in four short videos displaying various facial expressions. Using a cutting-edge neural network-based method we developed to quantify synchronization, we found that accuracy and speed in mimicry each predict emotion recognition outcomes. There was a positive correlation with accuracy, such that participants that were more accurate in the synchronization task had a higher emotion recognition score. Interestingly, and counterintuitively, participants who were slower in their mimicry responses achieved higher emotion recognition scores. Remarkably, this relationship appears task independent, underscoring the robust connection between deliberate facial mimicry and the ability to recognize others' emotions. These results are novel as they show for the first time generalizability of synchronization capacity - that one's ability to accurately mimic other people's facial expressions in a deliberate synchronization task is associated with their ability to recognize emotions in separate emotional recognition tasks. Moreover, they suggest that in individuals who are good at recognizing other people's emotions, higher cognitive process may take place before actual mimicry (as reflected in slower mimicry response). Taken together, our results suggest that individual differences in mimicry capacity relate to individual differences in emotion recognition.","Mindfulness-based interventions for adolescents have recently become popular \nworldwide. Research shows they have positive effects on both mental \nand physical health. The present study aims to demonstrate the correlation \nbetween mindfulness and few of the most important factors of adolescent \ndevelopment. Mindfulness practice is considered emotionally, socially and \nacademically beneficial for adolescents fostering lasting improvements in well-\nbeing, emotion regulation, anxiety and self-compassion. \nNumber of interventions and research on mindfulness are rapidly increasing, \ntherefore there is a need for more studies showing what an important role \nmindfulness plays in everyday life. \nThis study examined the correlation between mindfulness and mental health \nsymptoms, emotion regulation difficulties, anxiety, well-being and self-\ncompassion within a sample of Polish adolescents aged 12 to 15 years (N = 122). \nThe following tools were used in the study: Child and Adolescent Mindfulness \nMeasure (CAMM), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), Difficulties in \nEmotion Regulation Scale (DERS-SF), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children \n(STAIC), Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well Being (WEMBWS), Self-Compassion \nScale for Youth (SCS-Y SF). \nOverall, the results show that mindfulness negatively correlates with mental \nhealth symptoms, difficulties with emotion regulation and state anxiety, while \npositively correlating with well-being and self-compassion.  ","Research suggests a key role for emotion regulation and how stress affects sleep. Due to the extensive use of more top-down cognitive and behavioral approaches of emotion regulation and psychotherapy, research on more bottom-up 'experiential emotion regulation' as a mechanism underlying effective forms of emotion change, regulation and sleep is scarce. Experiential emotion regulation involves a rudimentary bottom-up raw sensory or 'interoceptive awareness' that guides our affective feelings or embodied 'experiential awareness' and its expression. To gain insight into this relationship, we examined the effects of a painful experience, the moderating effects of bottom-up experiential versus top-down cognitive emotion regulation in the recovery from the experience, and the effects in shaping sleep physiology by polysomnography (EEG). Research on how experiential emotion regulation modulates the impact of emotional stress on sleep becomes discussed, including: 1) dispositional experiential emotion regulation and sleep, 2) instructed experiential emotion regulation versus cognitive analytic processing and sleep, and 3) trained experiential emotion regulation versus cognitive reappraisal and sleep. Implications for sleep and interventions to improve sleep are discussed. Overall, our findings support experiential emotion regulation, which focuses on the awareness and expression of bodily feelings, is more effective in reducing pre-sleep stress than cognitive emotion regulation. Implications of the differential effects of these two forms of emotion regulation on sleep are discussed.","Research aimed to compare language used in emergencies to normal conversations, with particular interest in social identity markers and emotion use. Natural language data was gathered from footage of emergencies and analysed in terms of emotion and social identity theory. The data were split into 3 groups- ‘zero' responders interacting with each other, ‘zero' and first responders talking, and first responders speaking amongst themselves. Analysis using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)-22 software produced percentage frequencies of the use of key words relating to emotion and social identity. These frequencies were then compared to the average frequencies of word use according to LIWC's test kitchen corpus of everyday conversations using Cohen's d analyses. Findings suggest use of emotional and social identity related words differ significantly between emergency situations and everyday language, and to differing degrees depending on the combination of ‘zero' and first responders involved in the interaction. Results support existing literature regarding increased levels of social identification in emergency situations compared to everyday life. They also present insights into how emotionality is different in emergencies compared to normal life, and how this may relate to social identity.","Many studies have shown that negative stimuli – especially for threat-related content- are prioritised in the visual field compared to neutral stimuli. More recently, research on emotional attention has increasingly focused on the effects of positive stimuli. In the present study, attentional biases for negative (threat, disgust) and positive stimuli (romantic couple/baby face, food) were examined across three experiments using three different methods: spatial cueing task (Exp 1), dot probe task (Exp 2), and eye-tracking method (Exp 3). We also aimed to investigate the effects of motivational relevance on attention by manipulating participants' hunger state, in addition to examining intrinsic relevance of stimuli. In the first two experiments, an attentional bias was found for threat-related stimuli, whereas no attentional advantage was observed for stimuli with positive content. In the final experiment, results from the eye-tracking study revealed attentional biases toward both positive and negative stimuli in both early (initial orientation) and later (disengagement) stages of attention. However, disgust stimuli had enhanced attentional advantage compared to other emotional content in the both components of attention. The effects of motivational processes on attention—specifically, attention bias to food stimuli in hungry participants—were only observed in later attentional mechanisms. Overall, the results seem to support the relevance hypothesis; however, the disgust advantage in attention needs to be discussed in detail.","Background: When striving to attain their academic goals, students often experience setbacks that elicit negative emotions. Recent research reveals that the emotion regulation strategy of emotional integration (i.e., volitional exploration of emotions as they arise) predicts goal progress, while emotional suppression (i.e., efforts to hide or ignore emotions) negatively predicts these outcomes. However, little is known about the antecedents of these distinct emotion regulation strategies. Aim: This research proposes that the type of overarching goal students endorse dictates the type of emotion regulation strategies they use during goal striving. Specifically, it explores whether mastery and performance goals predict different emotion regulation strategies when navigating setbacks, ultimately affecting their goal attainment, well-being, progress, and effort. Method: Study 1 (daily diary) involved 366 American undergraduates, and Study 2 (experience sampling) included 187 Israeli undergraduates, all preparing for an exam. Both studies included baseline questionnaires on achievement goals and daily reports on goal progress, effort, well-being, and emotion regulation. Results: In Study 1, cross-level mediation analysis demonstrated that global performance goals were associated with daily emotional dysregulation, which in turn predicted reduced goal effort, decreased progress, and heightened depressed mood. Conversely, global mastery goals were linked to daily emotional integration, predicting increased goal effort, enhanced progress, and lower levels of depressed mood. Study 2, using multi-level modeling, revealed that morning performance goals predicted mid-day emotional dysregulation, which subsequently led to diminished daily progress and an elevated depressed mood. Additionally, global performance goals were found to predict mid-day emotional suppression, which was associated with increased depressed mood. In contrast, morning mastery-approach goals predicted mid-day emotional integration, which in turn predicted effort and progress toward the goal and less depressed mood. Conclusion: Mastery goals predicted emotional integration and positive goal outcomes, while performance goals predicted emotional dysregulation, suppression, and poorer outcomes, including increased depressed mood.","Background: Early conceptualizations of sexual arousal considered it an emotional response state prompted by exposure to erotic cues. The saliency effect of erotic cues was expected to be detected at the pre-attentional level of information processing, signaling human tendencies toward reproduction. Such an effect has been tested mainly in men, but studies reveal inconsistent result patterns across samples and methodologies.\n\n Aim and Methods: This study aimed to contribute to this research frame by testing the effects of three exposure conditions: (1) erotic images (male and female nudes); (2) non-erotic images (dressed men and women); and (3) neutral/objects images through a breaking continuous flash suppression task (b-CFS), in men. The b-CFS is a task aimed at capturing pre-attentional tendencies toward stimuli, hinting on their emotional saliency. Forty-seven cis-gender, heterosexual men participated in this study and were assigned to all exposure conditions. Results: After applying a Linear Mixed Model approach and controlling for low-level features of stimuli, findings revealed no main effects of exposure conditions on pre-attentional tendencies, i.e., reaction times toward the detection of stimuli. Additionally, Pearson's correlations showed no significant associations between reaction times toward the detection of erotic cues (nudes) and men's sexual excitation and sexual inhibition propensities.\n\n Conclusion: Contrary to theoretical expectations, men's pre-attentional responses captured by a b-CFS task did not support the emotional saliency effect often attributed to erotic cues. Findings align with empirical data challenging existing theoretical assumptions regarding automatic appraisal of sexual cues, pointing to the complexities underpinning the onset, maintenance, and function of sexual arousal in men.","Values are abstract ideals that serve as guiding principles in one's life. As inherently positive and desirable concepts, values are seen as motivators for actions and behaviors. However, research has largely ignored the possibility that values may elicit negative feelings despite being explicitly important to us. In the current study we aim to examine this possibility. Across two studies, 800 hundred participants over 18 years(M=41.6,SD=13.7) from the UK completed a questionnaire in which they were asked to indicate their level of positive/negative feelings towards a comprehensive list of values and then report the importance of these values to them. The results support our argument by showing that people can have negative feelings towards their values and that people can feel both positive and negative emotions towards their values simultaneously, which means feeling ambivalence. By using a mixed-effect model, our results revealed that less ambivalence values predicted higher ratings for value importance. This research contributes to the field of values on multiple levels. Theoretically, it will uncover new insights about values, such as the existence of negative emotions towards them, the presence of ambivalence towards values. These findings may inspire future studies to explore the effects of ambivalence on people's well-being, behaviors, cognition, and their affect.","Emotion beliefs shape individuals' motivation to regulate emotional experience, and cultural context influences how emotions are understood. Our previous cross-sectional study found that controllability belief predicted regulation strategy use at all four stages of Gross's (1998) process model, while usefulness and acceptability beliefs were only associated with use of suppression. Some of these associations were stronger for either Chinese or UK participants. The present study attempted to replicate these results using a 15-day daily diary study, rather than cross-sectional data. British (N = 80) and Chinese (N = 88) participants provided 2453 valid responses. We assessed how emotions beliefs affected the use of six strategies (situation modification, avoidance distraction, rumination, cognitive reappraisal, suppression) and their impact on daily affect. We also tested the association between regulation flexibility and affect. Chinese participants reported stronger emotion beliefs, consistent with prior findings. However, British participants reported more overall emotion regulation than Chinese participants. Chinese participants reported greater use of avoidance, cognitive reappraisal and suppression for positive emotions, while British participants applied these strategies more for negative emotions. Our multilevel models showed that increased daily use of avoidance, distraction, suppression and rumination was associated with heightened negative affect, controlling for previous day's affects. We found cross-lagged effects from previous day's affect and present strategy use, showing that individuals with more negative affects displayed higher level of strategy uses the next day. Results also revealed that greater controllability and acceptability beliefs about negative emotions predicted less variability in negative affect, with Chinese participants reporting stronger effect. Further, cultural differences moderated the association between between-strategy variability on negative affect, suggesting that flexibility in regulation strategy use may be beneficial, particular for Chinese participants. Our findings advance knowledge about the role of emotion beliefs as a motivational factor in emotion regulation and help to explain cultural differences.","Foreign languages are often learned in formal and restricted contexts, which can limit the emotional resonance of vocabulary in the second language (L2). This phenomenon, referred to as \"disembodied L2,\" likely affects the integration, use and pragmatics involved in foreign language communication. The present study sought to investigate behavioural and neurophysiological evidence for this disembodied representation of L2 emotional vocabulary and to examine how specific instructional methods focusing on emotional vocabulary might modulate these responses. A group of 28 Spanish undergraduate students of the Degree of English Studies participated in two classroom-based training sessions focused on emotional English vocabulary. Training sessions consisted of various generative exercises using a set of 36 English words (12 positive, 12 negative, 12 neutral). Before and after the training, participants underwent a lexical decision task in which the 36 trained English words were randomly presented alongside an additional set of 36 non-trained English words and 72 pseudowords. Both behavioural data and electrophysiological activity (via 64-channel EEG) were recorded during the tasks. Linear mixed-effects (LME) modeling revealed a significant training x phase x valence interaction for latency data. Specifically, reaction times were faster in post-training phase compared to pre-training, being such reduction greater for trained than non-trained stimuli and particularly for emotional (positive and negative) than neutral words. Furthermore, accuracy data showed a significant training effect, with trained words exhibiting a higher accuracy rate than non-trained stimuli. Preliminary ERP data showed differential training effects across positive and negative words at early (~175ms) and late (550ms) time windows, compatible with the modulation of EPN and LPP components, related to emotional processing. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of targeted instructional methods in enhancing the lexico-semantic representation and processing of L2 emotional vocabulary, highlighting the importance of developing well-designed training programs to promote a more efficient L2 use.","Olfaction holds a distinctive position among sensory modalities in eliciting emotions, given its close association with the limbic system and a direct connection between the primary olfactory cortex and the amygdala (Gottfried et al., 2002). Although previous imaging studies in humans have explored representations of affective valence and arousal, these dichotomous dimensions may not capture the richness of odor-evoked emotions. We aim to assess the neural representation of olfactory feelings, using a model with six specific dimensions (i.e., the Geneva Emotion and Odour Scale, GEOS). This tool was designed and validated to collect odor-related emotions, reflecting diverse adaptive functions (Chrea et al., 2009; Delplanque et al., 2012; Ferdenzi et al., 2013). We hypothesise that distinct and unique neural patterns will be associated with each GEOS dimension, providing insight into the functional characterisation of brain processing of odour-elicited feelings, beyond the hedonic dimension. To investigate this, 100 healthy adults were recruited for a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study where they were exposed to 50 everyday odors (e.g., foods, products, cosmetics) with varying olfactory profiles. Participants rated each odor using GEOS during scanning, to capture the elicited feelings. Covariates related to individual differences in olfactory perception, emotional abilities, and affective states were collected through pre-scanning subjective questionnaires, including Importance of Olfaction questionnaire (Croy et al., 2009), Clobert Adult Sensitivity Scale (Gauvrit et al., 2023), Rotterdam Emotional Intelligence Scale (Pirsoul et al., 2022), Profile Of Mood States (Fillion & Gagnon, 1999), and the Sniffin' Sticks test to objectively assess olfactory function. Data collection and analysis are ongoing. By linking brain activity to odor-elicited feelings, subjective and objective measures of olfactory perception, emotional abilities, and affective states, this study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the brain encodes affective responses to odors and how these representations may vary across individuals.","Reappraisal is an intentional attempt to change emotion through reconstrual or repurposing. Previous studies revealed that using reappraisal to decrease negative emotion will induce a reduction in late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes, a decrease in amygdala activity, increases in frontal theta oscillations and relative left frontal activity. However, most existing studies focus on manipulating regulation goals rather than manipulating different reappraisal tactics. In our study, we want to reveal the differences between positive reappraisal (reinterpret the cause, outcome and consequence in a more positive way) and less negative reappraisal (reinterpret in a less negative way). Seventeen university students with healthy mental states were recruited to perform an emotion regulation task, in which they need to watch or reappraise the emotion that are triggered by the pictures (40 neutral and 120 negative, from the Nencki Affective Picture System) according to the instructions. After each picture, they rated on positive emotion, negative emotion and arousal scales. At the same time, brain oscillations were measured using a 64-channel electroencephalography system and skin conductance level was measured with Biopack system. Results indicated that both positive reappraisal and less negative reappraisal reduced arousal, negative emotion and increased positive emotion. Less negative reappraisal is more effective in decreasing arousal level and negative emotion than positive reappraisal. Although positive reappraisal and less negative reappraisal seem to have a difference in early ERP components in frontal areas, and a difference in early LPP in parietal areas. There is a time lag between when the trigger was recorded and when the picture was presented the screen, therefore, we need to calibrate for each trial each participant in ERP analysis. The experiment and analysis is still ongoing, we are looking forward to the following results.","Emotions play a significant role in how individuals process and interpret their surroundings. When individuals share similar emotional experiences, they tend to exhibit synchronized neural responses, reflecting shared understanding. This study examines how emotional processing related to religious-sensitive content influences neural synchronization, particularly across different religious affiliations. We recruited 62 participants and divided them into three groups based on their religiosity: Religious, Secular, and Ex-Religious (ExRe). While undergoing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), participants watched videos containing both religiously sensitive and neutral content. Additionaly, participants filled a questionnaire reffering to the explicit emotions elicited by each video. The results revealed higher in-group neural synchronization within the Religious group, particularly in the Default, Control, Attention, and Somatomotor networks, suggesting a deeper emotional resonance and shared understanding of the narratives. Interestingly, although the ExRe group reported similar emotional responses to the Secular, they exhibited stronger neural synchronization with the Religious group, including regions related to emotional processing. This finding suggests that early-life religious experiences continue to influence emotional processing and neural responses, even after a significant change in belief system. Overall, these findings suggest that emotional responses to religious content can foster stronger neural synchronization within groups. The study highlights the enduring impact of early socio-cultural environments on emotional and neural processes, providing insights into how shared emotional experiences can shape group identity and neural representations.","Affective prosody, which conveys emotions such as anger and happiness through vocal tone, plays a crucial role in communication both within and across cultures. This study examines the effects of affective prosody on response time (RT), accuracy, and neural processing during a manual joystick movement task, as well as the cross-cultural recognition of affective prosody. In a vocally guided task-performance study, forty-five participants responded to emotionally spoken instructions indicating spatial directions (up, down, left, right) delivered in angry, happy, or neutral tones. The results showed that angry prosody elicited faster RTs compared to neutral and happy instructions, though no significant differences in accuracy were observed, likely due to the task's low cognitive demands. Furthermore, the effect of angry prosody on RT persisted into subsequent neutral trials, highlighting the lasting influence of affective prosody on performance. Additionally, differences between emotional and neutral conditions in ERP components were observed across multiple electrode sites, particularly in late components (ranging from 500–1300 ms post-stimulus presentation). The cross-cultural component of this study explores how emotions expressed in the Latvian language are perceived by individuals from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Vocal stimuli include words, syllables, and phonemes spoken in angry, happy, and neutral prosody. Students from multiple European countries are participating in an online emotion recognition task, where they listen to each sample and assign an emotional label (angry, happy, sad, surprised, neutral). The inclusion of additional emotional categories allows for the exploration of whether other emotional dimensions emerge and how they vary across cultures. Data collection is currently ongoing to ensure that data will be gathered and analyzed in time for presentation at the conference. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how emotional prosody influences behavioral and neural responses during task execution and how cultural background affects emotion recognition.","Internal bodily processes orchestrate a symphony of signals that the brain swiftly interprets, giving rise to an instantaneous monitoring of the internal bodily state—an intricate dance known as interoception, distinct from the external signal-oriented attention known as exteroception. Our overarching goal is to determine the relationship between attentional regulation (interoceptive and exteroceptive) and emotional recognition. A cohort of 76 participants engaged in three distinct emotional recognition tasks. Behavioral and EEG measures were captured during activities that emphasized interoceptive and exteroceptive attention, alongside a control group with unrestricted attention. Behavioral assessments included accuracy and reaction time analyses, while EEG potentials related to attentional recognition events were scrutinized. At the behavioral level, we found statistically significant differences in accuracy (H(2) =8.28, p.05) where the control group (M=814, SD=181.4) was slower the interoceptive group (M=713, SD=85.2) and the exteroceptive group (M=687, SD=153.6). At the physiological level, EEG distinguishes between interoceptive and exteroceptive attentional processes at the early level (P100) for the emotional face recognition task (F(2,4)=2.86,p","Prosodic patterns—acoustic features of speech such as intonation, rhythm, and speaking durations—are fundamental to social interactions, conveying emotions, intentions, and levels of engagement that often transcend the literal meaning of words. This study investigates how individual's prosodic features and dyadic prosodic alignment predict self-assessed interaction quality in first-time social encounters that progressively transitioned from casual to highly intimate discussions. A total of 120 participants, forming 60 same-gender unfamiliar dyads, engaged in the 'Fast Friends' protocol—a structured dialogue designed to foster interpersonal connection by gradually deepening the intimacy between interlocutors. Participants then rated the interaction quality using a set of questions aimed at evaluating their perceived Goodness of Interaction (GOI). Results revealed that an Elastic Net regression model that included prosodic features (e.g., pitch variability, mean pitch, speech rate, and speaking time) explained 28.5% of the variance in GOI scores, identifying individual pitch variability and alignment in pitch variability as the most predictive features. These findings suggest that greater variability in pitch reflects expressiveness and emotional engagement, while alignment in pitch variability signals synchronization and mutual attunement—both critical elements for fostering rapport and connection. In contrast, speech rate and its alignment had negligible effect on GOI scores. These findings highlight the intricate role of prosody in social interactions, demonstrating how individual expressiveness and interpersonal synchronization jointly enhance perceptions of interaction quality. By leveraging machine learning techniques and exploring diverse communicative aspects, our results point to a fundamental unique role of pitch variability and pitch variability alignment, in social bonding.","According to Construal Level Theory (CLT; Trope & Liberman, 2010), a stimulus/object can be mentally represented in a more or less abstract way depending on its psychological distance (emcompassing the temporal, spatial, social, and hypothetical dimensions). CLT posits a bidirectional link: the farther the stimulus, the more abstract its representation, and vice-versa. Previous research suggests emotions influence construal level, often distinguishing between \"basic\" and \"self-conscious\" emotions, assumed to induce low and high construal levels, respectively. However, some theories (e.g., Tracy & Robins, 2004) propose a finer distinction within these categories : taking the case of self-conscious emotions, for example, guilt is linked to the negative evaluation of a specific behavior and should induce a low construal level, while shame is associated with a negative evaluation of the global self and should induce a high construal level. Three pre-registered experiments aimed to replicate Han et al.'s (2014) findings on these emotions' effects on construal level and extend them to psychological distance. Participants recalled autobiographical episodes (shame vs. control vs. guilt), then completed the Behavior Identification Form (Vallacher & Wegner, 1989) and a psychological distance task (Fiedler et al., 2012, 2015). Study 1 found an effect of guilt, but not shame, on both measures. Studies 2 and 3 failed to replicate this effect. However, a language concreteness index in Study 3 (Brysbaert et al., 2014) suggested an opposite pattern. Complementary analyses of autobiographical recalls from Studies 1 and 2 indicated that guilt may lead to a higher, rather than lower, construal level than a control state. These findings challenge the initial hypotheses but align with CLT predictions.","Moral emotions such as anger and disgust play a critical role in human responses to social transgressions. While these associations have been well-documented in Western populations, their generalizability to non-Western contexts is less clear. This research examines the links between these emotions and aggressive punishments in Japan, a society with distinct cultural norms surrounding emotional expression. In Study 1 (N = 1,231), participants rated their emotional responses to moral transgressions described in scenarios and their motivations for direct and indirect aggression. Results revealed that anger was associated with both direct and indirect aggression, while disgust was uniquely linked to indirect aggression. Relational context influenced emotional responses, with stronger anger endorsements in second-party versus third-party punishment, but no such variation for disgust.Study 2 (N = 930) tested whether observers infer different aggressive tendencies from anger versus disgust expressions using non-verbal vocalizations. Participants anticipated higher direct aggression from anger expressions and higher indirect aggression from disgust expressions. While these patterns mirrored findings from Western populations, disgust perceptions were less differentiated across anger and disgust expressions, reflecting potential cultural influences on emotion processing.Overall, this research demonstrates that the functional roles of anger and disgust in motivating aggression are largely universal, yet shaped by cultural norms and display rules. By leveraging culturally validated non-verbal vocalizations, these findings highlight the interplay between universal adaptive functions of moral emotions and cultural variation in their expression and perception.","Understanding in romantic relationships is vital for well-being, trust, and satisfaction. However, accurately perceiving a partner's feelings can be challenging. While research suggests that directly asking a partner about their feelings (perspective getting) is the most effective strategy, many believe that imagining oneself in a partner's shoes (perspective taking) will help, despite that strategy being found to be less effective for accuracy. In our study, we explored the strategies individuals prefer for understanding their partner's feelings and what they believe their partner uses. We also examined how the discrepancy between these preferences and inferences impacts perceived understanding and relationship satisfaction.\n\nAcross Studies 1 and 2, we found that individuals favor both perspective-taking and perspective-getting as strategies for their partner to use. However, they often do not perceive their partner as engaging in perspective-taking. This gap was negatively correlated with relationship satisfaction. Study 3 delved into the different motivations behind the preference for each strategy, shedding light on the nuanced dynamics of empathic understanding in relationships.","Implementing learning activities that equip undergraduate students with social-emotional skills is fundamental to providing a comprehensive education that prepares students to navigate the challenges of academic life and their future careers. Research into the dynamics involved in scientific discovery and the learning of scientific disciplines has largely focused on cognitive aspects. Contrastingly, emotions have been marginalised as detrimental to a logical and analytical approach, and key elements of learning and discovery rooted in the emotional sphere—including motivation, social interactions and creativity—have been overlooked. To understand how emotions are perceived and used as a source of information in a scientific learning setting, we investigated the social-emotional skills that Biomedical Science undergraduate students develop while undertaking a laboratory research module by working in small groups. A qualitative, phenomenological approach was used to explore students' self-reported awareness of emotion in lab settings and their ability to recognise and regulate emotion in themselves and others. Data were collected with a qualitative survey and interviews. Findings suggest that a learning environment that fosters creativity, initiative, agency, and learning from errors—embedded in a context with complex social interactions—promotes the experience of a broad range of emotions and is suitable for embedding social-emotional learning. While working in the lab, students reported experiencing both situated and social emotions, attempted strategies for regulation and used emotion to navigate challenging experiences. Notably, some participants were unaware of the emotional skills they were developing, suggesting that signposting social-emotional learning activities could promote awareness. Important aspects emerging from this research indicate that embedding social-emotional learning effectively in science-based curricula, requires emotional scaffolding from peers and teachers, along with opportunities for iteration and reflection to create a safe space where students can experiment with emotion and refine strategies to develop intra and interpersonal emotion regulation skills.","Emotions are fundamentally social, shaping and being shaped by social interactions. A comprehensive understanding of emotions therefore requires shifting the focus from individual experiences to examining how emotions unfold in social interactions and relationships. This symposium brings together research that examines emotions within real-life, relational contexts, emphasizing their role in everyday life and across cultures.The first presenter discusses how couples' daily emotional experiences align with cultural ideals, by means of daily diary studies to demonstrate the role of cultural norms in shaping relational well-being. The second presenter introduces a novel relational context—self-criticism—using a data-driven clustering approach to examine cultural similarities and differences in emotions among individuals from Japan and Belgium. The third presenter shifts the focus to individuals' relational needs, employing a questionnaire study to explore how the frustration of agency and communion contributes to affect in general and depressive symptoms. Finally, the last presenter examines the feasibility of an innovative open-question design in a daily diary study to assess meaningful shared emotional experiences in couples' daily lives, addressing key challenges in dyadic research. Together, these presentations provide diverse perspectives and methodologies on the social nature of emotions in everyday life. By integrating approaches such as daily diary studies, experience sampling, and data-driven clustering, this symposium examines how culture, interpersonal dynamics, and psychological needs shape emotions and well-being in daily life interactions across various cultural and social contexts. \nSymposium Talk 1: Emotions in Intimate Relationships: A Cross-Cultural Perspective on Couples' Emotion Profiles and Partners' Well-being Cultural backgrounds shape unique modalities of relating with our intimate partners, influencing emotional dynamics within relationships. Because emotions stand for certain interpretations of reality, they may be either compatible or incompatible with cultural ideals. Emotions that fit the cultural ideals are valued, whereas emotions that violate the cultural models are condemned. The present study aims to explore empirically whether partners' daily life emotion experiences may unfold in emotional patterns (profiles) that fit cultural relationship goals and practices across Western and Eastern cultures. Additionally, we examined whether being characterized by an emotion profile, in line with the respective cultural relationship ideals, is meaningfully related to indicators of individual and relational well-being. In a 14-day daily study, partners from 150 couples (75 Belgian, 75 Japanese) daily rated their experiences of 16 emotions. Using K-means clustering of partners' emotion scores, we identified five couples' emotion profiles: 1) couple high negative/low positive emotions, 2) male partner high negative/low positive emotions, 3) couple high positive emotions, 4) couple disconnected, 5) couple calm. Number of days couples spent in the couple high positive emotions profile was higher in Belgium than in Japan, whereas the number of days in the couple disconnect and in the couple calm profile were higher in Japan than in Belgium (χ2 (4, N=1943)=1036.68, p",null,null,null,null,"Much of the ethnographic work on empathy to date has examined how a variety of social, cultural, political-economic, and moral processes amplify or suppress the tendency to empathize and influence whether empathy is used to help or to harm. Such contextual factors indicate that “complex” empathy, empathy that allows one to approximate why other people might be experiencing what they are, rarely if ever unfolds as quickly and automatically as some simulation theorists of empathy would suggest (Kogler and Stueber 2000, Stueber 2006). Yet much of this work remains at the level of social or cultural expectation about empathy and its appropriateness to given situations, not actually on how these expectations feed into and influence, or not, empathic processes as they unfold in ongoing naturally occurring behavior. This paper attempts to address some of these shortcomings in the existing ethnographic literature by examining, specifically, how people's experientially acquired tendency to empathize or not affects the unfolding of actual empathic processes, whether culturally encouraged or not. Using ethnographic examples from Toraja, Indonesia and from a psychotherapeutic setting in the United States, I illustrate not only how past emotional experiences may erupt into present ones in unexpected ways, but also to suggest that such dynamic emotional flows and the challenges they pose to accurate and sustained empathy are likely characteristic of all empathic engagements anywhere. Challenging the notion that complex empathy may be relatively automatic or rote, I argue that empathy that is more accurate than not and that endures for more than a fleeting moment will require the commitment to patience with and curiosity about other people that Kirmayer (2008) recommends, regardless of whether such commitment is culturally and situationally encouraged or not."]},"columns":[{"id":".details","name":"","type":null,"sortable":false,"resizable":false,"filterable":false,"searchable":false,"width":45,"align":"center","details":[{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["Given the well-established link between emotion regulation (ER) and mental health, adaptive ER processes are one of the fundamental areas of investigation in the clinical field. In this context, very recently, the concept of integrative emotion regulation (IER), which represents an open and accepting attitude towards emotional experiences and utilization of these experiences to guide behavior (Roth et al., 2019), has been proposed as an adaptive ER mode, grounded in Self-Determination Theory's organismic metatheory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 2012). However, research on IER is still in its infancy and, to our knowledge, there is no such study, especially in a Turkish sample. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the role of IER offered by SDT on a Turkish adult sample. Specifically, the research examined the relationship between IER and psychological well-being and the role of basic psychological needs satisfaction, namely autonomy, competence, and relatedness satisfaction, on this relationship as proposed by the SDT perspective. 250 participants completed an online survey including a demographic information form and questionnaires assessing the study variables. Pearson's correlation was used to examine correlations between variables of interest. Mediation analyses were performed using Jamovi's medmod module based on bootstrapping with 1000 bias-corrected and accelerated resamples. The findings indicated that IER use was positively correlated with psychological well-being, satisfaction of autonomy, competence and relatedness, and negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Mediation analysis demonstrated that autonomy satisfaction fully mediated, while competence satisfaction partially mediated the association between IER and psychological well-being.

We hypothesize that specific factors occurring just before an emotional shift significantly influence the subsequent expression and experience of emotions. The proposed study aims to identify and analyze the internal processes that occur during AEI, including changes in internal dialogue, physiological markers, and cognitive processes such as attention and perception shifts. By focusing on these pre-outburst moments, we seek to uncover potential intervention points for more effective emotion regulation. Our mixed-methods approach will combine physiological measurements, self-report questionnaires, and qualitative interviews. Participants (N = 150) will be monitored during induced emotional scenarios, with particular attention to the moments preceding emotional intensification. Data analysis will involve both quantitative statistical methods and qualitative thematic analysis to identify patterns and potential intervention strategies. We anticipate that this study will reveal distinct patterns of internal processes during AEI, providing insights into early intervention possibilities. These findings would have significant implications for developing more targeted and effective emotion regulation techniques, improving individuals' ability to manage emotions in real-time.

Identifying effective interpersonal ER strategies is crucial for improving support systems, enhancing parent-child relationships, and fostering emotional development in children with NDCs. Further, gaining insights into the profiles of interpersonal ER strategies can inform family interventions and educational practices, providing tools to navigate the challenges of co-regulating a neurodivergent child.

The aim of our study was to investigate the possibility that computer games with high visuospatial demands, can neutralize the impact of negative affect on the recall of emotionally charged words (Bower, 1981; Rinck et al., 1992; Forgas, 1991; Fiedler, 1988) in a healthy sample. This is based on the ability of such tasks to selectively disrupt sensory aspects of memory through competition for limited cognitive resources, as noted in previous research (Baddeley, 2000), (Kavanagh, 2001). In this study, two groups of participants (n=54) were induced into a negative emotional state after they were required to memorize a set of 10 words. However, before this task, one group had to take a 10-minute break to play Tetris. We found significant differences in the recall of words (p = 0.011, p < 0.05), with the Tetris-intervention group showing better results compared to the non-intervention group. We can conclude that there is a small difference in the recall of words between the two experimental groups. However, the positive effect of the Tetris video game on the results was minimal.

This impressive ability to perceive emotions can be biased by social anxiety which might lead to the overestimation of social threat. However, it is still under consideration how state anxiety influences our ability to process information about multiple faces. The current study aims to examine whether state anxiety affects the perception of face ensembles amplifying the perceived intensity of their average negative emotional expressions. We conducted an experiment with anxiety induction in order to analyze the accuracy and bias of participants' evaluations of emotional expressions in single faces and face ensembles with different intensity levels. The experiment included two sessions, the first without and the second with anxiety induction. In both sessions, participants performed an adjustment task for either a single face or face ensemble. The results indicated that anxious individuals overestimated the intensity of negative emotional expressions not only in the single face condition, but to a certain extent in the ensemble condition. However, this effect persists only at the low emotional intensity levels, disappearing at the high emotional intensity levels. We propose an explanation for the crowd amplification effect under anxiety based on a combinatorial interaction between two mechanisms. First, the noise-cancellation mechanism, which reduces the amount of noise involved in individual representations. Second, attention mechanism, which focuses cognitive resources on the most salient or emotionally intense elements in a crowd, thereby amplifying their perceived impact. Furthermore, we have shown that the crowd amplification effect in state anxiety stemmed from a systematic bias, rather than the impaired accuracy of emotion perception.

Hence, this research aims to systematically investigate the role of emotion intensity (on face and/or background) on facial emotion recognition. We hypothesised that the relative contribution of face and background on emotion recognition fluctuates depending on emotion intensity. In Experiment 1, 103 participants were recruited online to identify happy, sad, and neutral facial expressions presented within positive, negative, and neutral backgrounds. Happy and sad faces were morphed to depict both high and low-intensity levels. Participants rated face emotion from -4 (strongly sad) to 4 (strongly happy). Results showed that background influenced emotion recognition when the face was ambiguous (i.e., low intensity). However, as face intensity increased, it became the dominant factor, diminishing the background's influence. Experiment 2 employed eye-tracking to examine mechanisms involved in face emotion recognition, while intensity and type of background varied. Background stimuli were static or dynamic (movies) in a between-participants design. As in Experiment 1, participants in Experiment 2 viewed backgrounds and then faces superimposed onto the background. They were asked to rate face emotions on a scale from -4 (strongly sad) to 4 (strongly happy). Preliminary analyses from Experiment 2 showed that intensity and type of background also affected gaze scan paths within facial regions, supporting and extending the behavioural effects from Experiment 1.

Faces with low emotional intensity rely more on background for accurate emotion recognition, a reliance that is heightened in dynamic backgrounds."]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["People tend to automatically mimic one another's facial expressions - a phenomenon known as facial mimicry, widely regarded as important for understanding others' emotions. Although its importance is well documented, there has been little exploration of whether individuals' capacity to mimic predicts their capacity for emotion recognition. To test this, thirty-five participants completed three emotion recognition tasks: (i) a facial expression and emotion word congruency task; (ii) a slow-motion facial expression video task in which participants paused once they recognized the emotion; and (iii) Film task - a complex emotion-matching task. Moreover, participants took part in a mimicry task in which they were instructed to mimic actors in four short videos displaying various facial expressions. Using a cutting-edge neural network-based method we developed to quantify synchronization, we found that accuracy and speed in mimicry each predict emotion recognition outcomes. There was a positive correlation with accuracy, such that participants that were more accurate in the synchronization task had a higher emotion recognition score. Interestingly, and counterintuitively, participants who were slower in their mimicry responses achieved higher emotion recognition scores. Remarkably, this relationship appears task independent, underscoring the robust connection between deliberate facial mimicry and the ability to recognize others' emotions. These results are novel as they show for the first time generalizability of synchronization capacity - that one's ability to accurately mimic other people's facial expressions in a deliberate synchronization task is associated with their ability to recognize emotions in separate emotional recognition tasks. Moreover, they suggest that in individuals who are good at recognizing other people's emotions, higher cognitive process may take place before actual mimicry (as reflected in slower mimicry response).

Conversely, global mastery goals were linked to daily emotional integration, predicting increased goal effort, enhanced progress, and lower levels of depressed mood. Study 2, using multi-level modeling, revealed that morning performance goals predicted mid-day emotional dysregulation, which subsequently led to diminished daily progress and an elevated depressed mood. Additionally, global performance goals were found to predict mid-day emotional suppression, which was associated with increased depressed mood.

Such an effect has been tested mainly in men, but studies reveal inconsistent result patterns across samples and methodologies.\n\n Aim and Methods: This study aimed to contribute to this research frame by testing the effects of three exposure conditions: (1) erotic images (male and female nudes); (2) non-erotic images (dressed men and women); and (3) neutral/objects images through a breaking continuous flash suppression task (b-CFS), in men. The b-CFS is a task aimed at capturing pre-attentional tendencies toward stimuli, hinting on their emotional saliency. Forty-seven cis-gender, heterosexual men participated in this study and were assigned to all exposure conditions.

This study investigates how individual's prosodic features and dyadic prosodic alignment predict self-assessed interaction quality in first-time social encounters that progressively transitioned from casual to highly intimate discussions. A total of 120 participants, forming 60 same-gender unfamiliar dyads, engaged in the 'Fast Friends' protocol—a structured dialogue designed to foster interpersonal connection by gradually deepening the intimacy between interlocutors. Participants then rated the interaction quality using a set of questions aimed at evaluating their perceived Goodness of Interaction (GOI). Results revealed that an Elastic Net regression model that included prosodic features (e.g., pitch variability, mean pitch, speech rate, and speaking time) explained 28.5% of the variance in GOI scores, identifying individual pitch variability and alignment in pitch variability as the most predictive features. These findings suggest that greater variability in pitch reflects expressiveness and emotional engagement, while alignment in pitch variability signals synchronization and mutual attunement—both critical elements for fostering rapport and connection. In contrast, speech rate and its alignment had negligible effect on GOI scores. These findings highlight the intricate role of prosody in social interactions, demonstrating how individual expressiveness and interpersonal synchronization jointly enhance perceptions of interaction quality. By leveraging machine learning techniques and exploring diverse communicative aspects, our results point to a fundamental unique role of pitch variability and pitch variability alignment, in social bonding."]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["According to Construal Level Theory (CLT; Trope & Liberman, 2010), a stimulus/object can be mentally represented in a more or less abstract way depending on its psychological distance (emcompassing the temporal, spatial, social, and hypothetical dimensions). CLT posits a bidirectional link: the farther the stimulus, the more abstract its representation, and vice-versa. Previous research suggests emotions influence construal level, often distinguishing between \"basic\" and \"self-conscious\" emotions, assumed to induce low and high construal levels, respectively. However, some theories (e.g., Tracy & Robins, 2004) propose a finer distinction within these categories : taking the case of self-conscious emotions, for example, guilt is linked to the negative evaluation of a specific behavior and should induce a low construal level, while shame is associated with a negative evaluation of the global self and should induce a high construal level. Three pre-registered experiments aimed to replicate Han et al.'s (2014) findings on these emotions' effects on construal level and extend them to psychological distance. Participants recalled autobiographical episodes (shame vs. control vs. guilt), then completed the Behavior Identification Form (Vallacher & Wegner, 1989) and a psychological distance task (Fiedler et al., 2012, 2015). Study 1 found an effect of guilt, but not shame, on both measures. Studies 2 and 3 failed to replicate this effect. However, a language concreteness index in Study 3 (Brysbaert et al., 2014) suggested an opposite pattern. Complementary analyses of autobiographical recalls from Studies 1 and 2 indicated that guilt may lead to a higher, rather than lower, construal level than a control state.

While these associations have been well-documented in Western populations, their generalizability to non-Western contexts is less clear. This research examines the links between these emotions and aggressive punishments in Japan, a society with distinct cultural norms surrounding emotional expression. In Study 1 (N = 1,231), participants rated their emotional responses to moral transgressions described in scenarios and their motivations for direct and indirect aggression. Results revealed that anger was associated with both direct and indirect aggression, while disgust was uniquely linked to indirect aggression. Relational context influenced emotional responses, with stronger anger endorsements in second-party versus third-party punishment, but no such variation for disgust.Study 2 (N = 930) tested whether observers infer different aggressive tendencies from anger versus disgust expressions using non-verbal vocalizations. Participants anticipated higher direct aggression from anger expressions and higher indirect aggression from disgust expressions. While these patterns mirrored findings from Western populations, disgust perceptions were less differentiated across anger and disgust expressions, reflecting potential cultural influences on emotion processing.Overall, this research demonstrates that the functional roles of anger and disgust in motivating aggression are largely universal, yet shaped by cultural norms and display rules. By leveraging culturally validated non-verbal vocalizations, these findings highlight the interplay between universal adaptive functions of moral emotions and cultural variation in their expression and perception."]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["Understanding in romantic relationships is vital for well-being, trust, and satisfaction. However, accurately perceiving a partner's feelings can be challenging. While research suggests that directly asking a partner about their feelings (perspective getting) is the most effective strategy, many believe that imagining oneself in a partner's shoes (perspective taking) will help, despite that strategy being found to be less effective for accuracy. In our study, we explored the strategies individuals prefer for understanding their partner's feelings and what they believe their partner uses. We also examined how the discrepancy between these preferences and inferences impacts perceived understanding and relationship satisfaction.\n\nAcross Studies 1 and 2, we found that individuals favor both perspective-taking and perspective-getting as strategies for their partner to use. However, they often do not perceive their partner as engaging in perspective-taking. This gap was negatively correlated with relationship satisfaction.

Research into the dynamics involved in scientific discovery and the learning of scientific disciplines has largely focused on cognitive aspects. Contrastingly, emotions have been marginalised as detrimental to a logical and analytical approach, and key elements of learning and discovery rooted in the emotional sphere—including motivation, social interactions and creativity—have been overlooked. To understand how emotions are perceived and used as a source of information in a scientific learning setting, we investigated the social-emotional skills that Biomedical Science undergraduate students develop while undertaking a laboratory research module by working in small groups. A qualitative, phenomenological approach was used to explore students' self-reported awareness of emotion in lab settings and their ability to recognise and regulate emotion in themselves and others. Data were collected with a qualitative survey and interviews. Findings suggest that a learning environment that fosters creativity, initiative, agency, and learning from errors—embedded in a context with complex social interactions—promotes the experience of a broad range of emotions and is suitable for embedding social-emotional learning. While working in the lab, students reported experiencing both situated and social emotions, attempted strategies for regulation and used emotion to navigate challenging experiences. Notably, some participants were unaware of the emotional skills they were developing, suggesting that signposting social-emotional learning activities could promote awareness. Important aspects emerging from this research indicate that embedding social-emotional learning effectively in science-based curricula, requires emotional scaffolding from peers and teachers, along with opportunities for iteration and reflection to create a safe space where students can experiment with emotion and refine strategies to develop intra and interpersonal emotion regulation skills."]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["Emotions are fundamentally social, shaping and being shaped by social interactions. A comprehensive understanding of emotions therefore requires shifting the focus from individual experiences to examining how emotions unfold in social interactions and relationships. This symposium brings together research that examines emotions within real-life, relational contexts, emphasizing their role in everyday life and across cultures.The first presenter discusses how couples' daily emotional experiences align with cultural ideals, by means of daily diary studies to demonstrate the role of cultural norms in shaping relational well-being. The second presenter introduces a novel relational context—self-criticism—using a data-driven clustering approach to examine cultural similarities and differences in emotions among individuals from Japan and Belgium. The third presenter shifts the focus to individuals' relational needs, employing a questionnaire study to explore how the frustration of agency and communion contributes to affect in general and depressive symptoms. Finally, the last presenter examines the feasibility of an innovative open-question design in a daily diary study to assess meaningful shared emotional experiences in couples' daily lives, addressing key challenges in dyadic research. Together, these presentations provide diverse perspectives and methodologies on the social nature of emotions in everyday life. By integrating approaches such as daily diary studies, experience sampling, and data-driven clustering, this symposium examines how culture, interpersonal dynamics, and psychological needs shape emotions and well-being in daily life interactions across various cultural and social contexts. \nSymposium Talk 1: Emotions in Intimate Relationships: A Cross-Cultural Perspective on Couples' Emotion Profiles and Partners' Well-being Cultural backgrounds shape unique modalities of relating with our intimate partners, influencing emotional dynamics within relationships. Because emotions stand for certain interpretations of reality, they may be either compatible or incompatible with cultural ideals. Emotions that fit the cultural ideals are valued, whereas emotions that violate the cultural models are condemned. The present study aims to explore empirically whether partners' daily life emotion experiences may unfold in emotional patterns (profiles) that fit cultural relationship goals and practices across Western and Eastern cultures. Additionally, we examined whether being characterized by an emotion profile, in line with the respective cultural relationship ideals, is meaningfully related to indicators of individual and relational well-being. In a 14-day daily study, partners from 150 couples (75 Belgian, 75 Japanese) daily rated their experiences of 16 emotions. Using K-means clustering of partners' emotion scores, we identified five couples' emotion profiles: 1) couple high negative/low positive emotions, 2) male partner high negative/low positive emotions, 3) couple high positive emotions, 4) couple disconnected, 5) couple calm. Number of days couples spent in the couple high positive emotions profile was higher in Belgium than in Japan, whereas the number of days in the couple disconnect and in the couple calm profile were higher in Japan than in Belgium (χ2 (4, N=1943)=1036.68, p"]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["NA"]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["NA"]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["NA"]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["NA"]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["Much of the ethnographic work on empathy to date has examined how a variety of social, cultural, political-economic, and moral processes amplify or suppress the tendency to empathize and influence whether empathy is used to help or to harm. Such contextual factors indicate that “complex” empathy, empathy that allows one to approximate why other people might be experiencing what they are, rarely if ever unfolds as quickly and automatically as some simulation theorists of empathy would suggest (Kogler and Stueber 2000, Stueber 2006). Yet much of this work remains at the level of social or cultural expectation about empathy and its appropriateness to given situations, not actually on how these expectations feed into and influence, or not, empathic processes as they unfold in ongoing naturally occurring behavior. This paper attempts to address some of these shortcomings in the existing ethnographic literature by examining, specifically, how people's experientially acquired tendency to empathize or not affects the unfolding of actual empathic processes, whether culturally encouraged or not. Using ethnographic examples from Toraja, Indonesia and from a psychotherapeutic setting in the United States, I illustrate not only how past emotional experiences may erupt into present ones in unexpected ways, but also to suggest that such dynamic emotional flows and the challenges they pose to accurate and sustained empathy are likely characteristic of all empathic engagements anywhere. Challenging the notion that complex empathy may be relatively automatic or rote, I argue that empathy that is more accurate than not and that endures for more than a fleeting moment will require the commitment to patience with and curiosity about other people that Kirmayer (2008) recommends, regardless of whether such commitment is culturally and situationally encouraged or not."]}]}]},{"id":"Nb","name":"Nb","type":"character","maxWidth":50},{"id":"Title","name":"Title","type":"character","minWidth":400},{"id":"Authors","name":"Authors","type":"character","minWidth":200},{"id":"Abstract","name":"Abstract","type":"character","show":false}],"searchable":true,"pagination":false,"highlight":true,"dataKey":"14cd2d7f0ea7e35c90f6b6ceec92fca0"},"children":[]},"class":"reactR_markup"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
