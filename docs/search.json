    "text": "Symposium submission guidelines\nSymposium sessions consist of a number of presenters discussing a common topic or theme in a manner that brings new insights to the subject. Submissions are welcome from scholars in all relevant disciplines for symposia of up to four talks and one discussant or five talks without a discussant. Submissions that include multiple disciplines are particularly encouraged in order to facilitate cross-disciplinary exchange. Each presenter in a symposium will be allocated 15 minutes plus three minutes for questions. Symposia presentations can involve co-authors, who will be listed in the printed program.\nIn order to propose a symposium, the lead proposer will need the name and affiliation of the symposium presenters, co-authors, and discussant, if one is used. They will also need a symposium abstract no longer than 250 words explaining why the talks should be linked, and each presenter’s abstract, which should be a maximum of 250 words. An individual can present only once at the conference as first-author but can be a co-author or discussant on multiple submissions.\nIf you have any questions, please contact us at CERE2025@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr."
