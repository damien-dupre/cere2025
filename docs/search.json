Attendees can be listed as a co-author on multiple presentations, and speakers can also participate separately in symposia as a discussant.\nAll submissions must be written in English and will be subject to double-blind peer review by an international scientific committee. In order to facilitate the review process, submissions should indicate one or more keywords that describe the work. A list of keywords can be found below.\nThe conference will be an opportunity to promote unpublished scientific research on emotions. These will therefore be preferred to proposals for papers on data and/or theoretical reflections that have already been published (this does not apply to proposals for data workshops). Proposals for papers on scientific research that does not deal with emotions, or that promote political or commercial issues with the aim of influencing scientific research, will be rejected by the Scientific Committee.\nThe scientific committee will attach particular importance to the scientific quality of the work, the presentation of original data and, in the case of symposia, the homogeneity of the various papers. All abstracts must clearly articulate the aim of the study or theoretical work and outline the outcomes. For empirical research, it is essential to detail the sample, experimental conditions (if applicable), types of stimuli, and results."

Symposia presentations can involve co-authors, who will be listed in the printed program.\nIn order to propose a symposium, the lead proposer will need the name and affiliation of the symposium presenters, co-authors, and discussant, if one is used.

    "text": "Posters and Poster Group Presentation\nYou are strongly encouraged to set up posters in the morning before the first conference session. You are welcome to leave your poster up till the end of the day. The following are the guidelines for poster presentations:\n\nPoster size is limited to 84.1 x 118.9 cm (A0 format maximum). Only portrait layouts are supported. We will provide posterboards and stationery for attaching your poster.\nYour poster must contain the abstract title and the name(s) of the poster author(s).\nQR codes may be included on posters and handouts so long as the code does not lead to a website or materials promoting or marketing a company or product\nYou should bear in mind that your illustrations will be viewed from distances of 3 feet or more. All lettering should be sized accordingly.\n\n\nPoster Printing Services\nIf you plan to print your poster after arriving in Grenoble, here’s how to proceed.\n\nSend your poster in PDF format and at the correct size to the following email address: grenoble.campus@corep.fr\n\nBe sure to specify the size A0 portrait and the type of paper you want.\nYou can choose between two paper types:\n\nPaper 180g matte (“papier 180g mat” in French)\nPaper 200g glossy (“papier 200g brillant” in French)\nEco fabric (“Tissu éco” in French) more affordable, with a slightly textured (“grainy”) surface\nFoldable fabric (“Tissu pliable in French) can be folded instead of rolled; also has a slightly textured surface\n\n\nIf your file is correctly formatted and in PDF, they can print it on the same day you place the order.\n\nPlease note that the print shop is about a 15-minute walk from the conference venue. Between July 15th and July 18th, it will be open from 9.30am to 5.30pm.\n\nCorep\n\nAbout 15 minutes’ walk from the conference venue\nWebsite: https://www.corep.fr/fr/agence/corep-saint-martin-dheres/\nPhone: +33 (0)4 76 51 23 05\nEmail: grenoble.campus@corep.fr\nAddress: 2, rue du Tour de l’Eau Z.I. Champ Roman 38400 St-Martin-d-Heres\nOpening hours: 9.30am-5.30pm Monday to Friday, closed Saturdays and Sundays as well as July 14th (Bastille Day)\n\n\n\n\nPoster Group Presentation\nFor this edition of CERE, we are introducing a new format for poster presentations, which we are calling the “Poster Group Presentations”. Posters will be grouped thematically and displayed side by side. At the start of each Poster Session, each presenter in the group will have 5 minutes to present their work in front of their poster, one after the other. Presenters within each group are free to decide amongst themselves the order in which they will speak. Once the short presentations are complete, the usual informal discussions can begin.\n\n\nParticipation in this new format is encouraged but entirely optional. If you would prefer not to take part, feel free to let the other presenters of your group know it.\nOur aim with this new feature is to give every poster presenter the full attention of the CERE attendees and the recognition their work deserves. We hope you will support and enjoy this addition to the program.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nSequence generated with Gemini"
