# Prof. Agnes Moors

## Bio

Agnes Moors is Full Professor at KU Leuven and Associate Member of the Swiss Center for Affective Sciences. She combines theoretical work informed by philosophy with empirical research. Her theoretical work focuses on the comparison of emotion theories, the conceptual analysis of automaticity, the critical analysis of dual-process models, and the development of a goal-directed model for behaviour causation. Her empirical work examines the role of goal-directed processes in emotional and (seemingly) maladaptive behaviour in daily life and psychopathology using state of the art experimental behavioural and neuroscientific methods.
