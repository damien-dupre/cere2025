## Symposium and Oral Presentations

For those giving Oral Presentations, you will be afforded a **12-minute slot for your talk and 2 minutes for any audience questions**.

All presentations will be uploaded onto a computer provided by Grenoble Alpes University and will be deleted at the end of each day.

::: {.callout-important}
Please bring your **presentation on a USB stick**, along with a PDF version as a backup in case your original file format encounters issues.

We kindly ask you to **arrive 15 minutes before the start of your session to upload your presentation**. A volunteer assigned to your room will be there to assist you.

If you really need to, **you may use your own laptop, but make sure to bring your adapter**. Lecture halls are equipped with HDMI cables.
:::

In all rooms in the conference, the projection systems are in the 16:9 format.

Symposia will be moderated by the symposium organizers. Individual talks sessions will be assigned a moderator. Moderators are indicated in the [CERE2025 program](../program/index.qmd). For oral presentations, please **make sure to contact your session moderator** before your scheduled session. You may be asked to send your slides in advance.

## Posters and Poster Group Presentation

You are strongly encouraged to **set up posters in the morning before the first conference session**. You are welcome to leave your poster up till the end of the day. The following are the guidelines for poster presentations:

- Poster size is limited to 84.1 x 118.9 cm (**A0 format maximum**). **Only portrait layouts are supported**. We will provide posterboards and stationery for attaching your poster.

- Your poster must contain the abstract title and the name(s) of the poster author(s).

- QR codes may be included on posters and handouts so long as the code does not lead to a website or materials promoting or marketing a company or product

- You should bear in mind that your illustrations will be viewed from distances of 3 feet or more. All lettering should be sized accordingly.

### Poster Printing Services

If you plan to print your poster after arriving in Grenoble, here’s how to proceed.

1. **Send your poster in PDF format** and at the correct size to the following email address: [grenoble.campus@corep.fr](mailto:grenoble.campus@corep.fr)

Be sure to specify the size **A0 portrait** and the type of paper you want.

You can choose between two paper types:

- Paper 180g matte ("papier 180g mat" in French)
- Paper 200g glossy ("papier 200g brillant" in French)
- Eco fabric ("Tissu éco" in French) more affordable, with a slightly textured ("grainy") surface
- Foldable fabric ("Tissu pliable in French) can be folded instead of rolled; also has a slightly textured surface

2. If your file is correctly formatted and in PDF, they can print it on the same day you place the order.

### Poster Group Presentation

For this edition of CERE, we are introducing a new format for poster presentations, which we are calling the **"Poster Group Presentations"**. Posters will be grouped thematically and displayed side by side. At the start of each Poster Session, **each presenter in the group will have 5 minutes to present their work in front of their poster, one after the other**. Presenters within each group are free to decide amongst themselves the order in which they will speak. Once the short presentations are complete, the usual informal discussions can begin.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}
Participation in this new format is encouraged but **entirely optional**. If you would prefer not to take part, feel free to let the other presenters of your group know it.

Our aim with this new feature is to give every poster presenter the full attention of the CERE attendees and the recognition their work deserves. We hope you will support and enjoy this addition to the program.
