## Symposium and Oral Presentations

For those giving Oral Presentations, you will be afforded a 12-minute slot for your talk and two minutes for any audience questions.

Speakers can present using the computers in the rooms or their own laptops, and we will provide audio. In all rooms in the conference, the projection systems are in the 16:9 format.

Symposia will be moderated by the symposium organizers. Individual talks sessions will be assigned a moderator. Moderators will be communicated in the CERE2025 program in the next weeks. For oral presentations, please make sure to contact your session moderator before your scheduled session. You may be asked to send your slides in advance.

## Posters

You are strongly encouraged to set up posters in the morning before the first conference session. You are welcome to leave your poster up till the end of the day. The following are the guidelines for poster presentations:

- Poster size is limited to 121cm x 121cm (4 x 4 ft, A0 format maximum). Landscape and portrait layouts are both supported. We will provide posterboards and stationery for attaching your poster.

- Your poster must contain the abstract title and the name(s) of the poster author(s).

- QR codes may be included on posters and handouts so long as the code does not lead to a website or materials promoting or marketing a company or product

- You should bear in mind that your illustrations will be viewed from distances of 3 feet or more. All lettering should be sized accordingly.
